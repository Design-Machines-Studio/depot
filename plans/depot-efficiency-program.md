# Depot Efficiency Program -- Phase Index

Approved plan: `~/.claude/plans/mission-you-are-curious-neumann.md` (2026-08-07).
This file is the run-time index for orchestrators. Each phase directory carries
its own `manifest.json` + `prompts/`. Phases execute through `/pipeline-run`
(or resume, for R3.0) -- never by manual replication (failure mode 1).

Status 2026-08-07 (late): **R0 MERGED** (PR #17; landed stronger than planned --
transactional `emit-cost-summary` + mandatory `record-attempt`; first real
artifact measured 5/5 lanes, 365,216 tokens, $2.996, 100% OpenRouter with Codex
at cap; leftover: baseline copy to docs/cost-baselines/ folded into R1 chunk 01
step 0). **R3.0 MERGED** (PRs #18/#19: chunk 05 packaging + chunk 06 acceptance
harness, 1000-line env-gated integration suite, REQ-E2E-01..12). **R3 chunk 00
DONE** (PR #22): `OPENROUTER_AVAILABLE` now resolves three outcomes and permits
the sunset-bound interim batch only when the broker is absent. R3.1/R3.2 remain
PENDING strictly for broker-owned transport; gate = broker `status: ready` on
a supported host + an executed acceptance pass (`WORKFLOW_AUTHORITY_E2E=1`).
**Next: R1** (prompts refreshed against merged
state; versions now read-current-then-bump).

| Phase | Dir | Prompts | Entry gate | Exit gate |
|-------|-----|---------|-----------|-----------|
| R0 measurement backbone | `plans/r0-measurement-backbone/` | 3 (DONE) | none | >=3 real runs with per-lane cost tables; baselines committed to `docs/cost-baselines/` (1/3 runs done; baseline commit owed -> R1-01 step 0) |
| R1 review burn cuts | `plans/r1-review-burn-cuts/` | 6 | R0 merged (MET) | >=30% drop in review input-bytes on a real loop run, final full fan-out intact |
| P1 probe | scratchpad script, not a phase | 0 | R0 merged | survivor rate recorded; >=40% AND >=2 hunk-local lanes -> R2 reuse chunks live, else killed |
| R2 pre-gates (+ probe-gated reuse) | `plans/r2-pre-gates-evidence-reuse/` | 2 (+2 authored only if probe passes) | R0+R1 merged, probe verdict recorded | real-run bytes delta vs R0 baseline |
| R3 broker landing + routing | `plans/r3-broker-golive-routing/` | 3 (chunk 00 interim macOS operator-batch authorization DONE via PR #22; R3.0 Linux landing DONE via PRs #18/#19; chunks 01/02 parked) | chunk 01: broker `status: ready` on ANY supported host + executed E2E pass | interim: automated OpenRouter lanes on macOS under receipted batch authorization, sunset-bound. final: bulk lanes via broker, interim retired |
| R4 run report (+ gated kernel dispatch) | `plans/r4-run-report/` | 1 now (3 kernel prompts authored only if entry gate met) | report: none. kernel: >=5 runs show orchestration >=20% of residual spend | teammate diagnoses a failed run from the report alone |
| R5 Agent Plugins interop | `plans/r5-agent-plugins-interop/` | 1 | R1 merged | `--check` green in `--all` + preflight; one plugin passes vendored AP schemas |
| Rail-exhaustion ask-gate | `plans/rail-exhaustion-ask-gate/` | 1 | none (answers the 2026-08-08 zero-chunk BLOCKED incident; run at next Codex window, BEFORE the R1 rerun) | rail exhaustion pauses on human_gate with live per-operator rail status and receipted run-scoped authorization; headless default park; broker gate + final review + sensitive paths never overridable |

R3.0 resume steps (no new prompts -- finish the paid-for run):
1. In the Codex clone, merge `pipeline/macos-authority-broker/05-linux-packaging-admin`
   into `ai/workflow-authority-linux-m1` and record its completion receipt.
2. Execute the existing `plans/macos-authority-broker/prompts/06-linux-integration-acceptance.md`
   through the same run (`workflow-authority-linux-m1-20260803`), its gates unchanged.
3. Reconcile the feature branch with current main (main's kernel 0.8.0 content wins on overlap).
4. Full dm-review-loop (security class = full tier, zero-deferral), merge to main.
5. Clean the eight `04b-*`/`04c-*`/`04d-*`/`04e-*`/`04f-*` sub-worktrees + branches per
   the repo-cleanup contract with a Branch & Worktree Inventory.

Darwin broker milestone: AUTHORED at `plans/darwin-broker-milestone/`
(2 chunks, security class): 01 darwin platform layer + launchd packaging +
peer credentials; 02 darwin ops/validator/acceptance + AKIA-vector defang.
Retires interim mode on macOS once Travis performs the live install/enroll
per OPERATIONS.md darwin section. Run AFTER the chain-verification queue
completes (no file conflicts with it, but serialize merges). Sunset
2026-09-07; Linux hosts return ~2026-08-22.

Harness-lessons phase AUTHORED at `plans/harness-lessons/` (4 chunks): lane
claims, kernel run budgets, memory-capture fix + codify auto-apply, and the
audit-over-approval authorization relaxation (operator directive 2026-08-10).
Run after chain-verification lands; chunk 04 supersedes parts of R3 chunk 00.

Kill switches introduced by this program (all fail OPEN to full coverage; every
receipt records active switches): `DM_REVIEW_LOOP_FULL_FANOUT`,
`DM_REVIEW_FULL_DIFF`, `PIPELINE_FULL_TIER_REVIEW`, `PIPELINE_NO_GATE_ONLY`,
`DM_REVIEW_NO_EVIDENCE_REUSE` (probe-gated chunk only).
