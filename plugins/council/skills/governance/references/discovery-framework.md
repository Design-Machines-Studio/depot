# Co-op OS Discovery Framework

> **Related sections:** → Governance Modules (`governance-modules.md`) → Red Flags (`red-flags.md`) → Bylaw Analysis (`bylaw-analysis.md`)

## Overview

Discovery determines what we build and how we build it. Every engagement starts here.

**Core principle**: Understand the governance reality, not just the documentation.

---

## Statutory Compliance Pre-Check

**Before any design work, verify the co-op is currently compliant with BC Act requirements.**

### Critical Checks (Do First)

| Check | Requirement | Red Flag If |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Member count | Minimum 3 at all times (s.10) | Fewer than 3 for any period |
| Director count | Minimum 3 directors (s.72) | Fewer than 3 |
| Canadian residency | Majority of directors Canadian (s.72(1)(a)) | <50% Canadian |
| BC residency | At least 1 director BC resident (s.72(1)(b)) | No BC director |
| AGM timing | Within 15 months of previous AGM (s.143) | >15 months since last AGM |
| Annual report | Filed within 2 months of AGM (s.126) | Overdue or unfiled |
| Co-op type | Housing co-op vs. standard | Different thresholds apply |

### Quick Compliance Questions

Ask early in first conversation:
1. "How many members do you currently have?" (Must be ≥3)
2. "How many directors, and where do they live?" (≥3, majority Canadian, ≥1 BC)
3. "When was your last AGM?" (Must be within 15 months)
4. "Is your annual report current?" (Filed within 2 months of AGM)
5. "Are you a housing cooperative?" (3/4 threshold vs 2/3)
6. "Do you have any non-member directors?" (Max 1/5 if rules allow)
7. "Do you have investment shareholders?" (Separate voting track)
8. "Are any members located more than 80km from where meetings are held?" (Proxy eligibility)
9. "Do your rules allow electronic meetings or remote participation?" (s.139)
10. "Do you have both membership shares and investment shares?" (Different voting rights)

**If any red flags**: Address compliance issues before or alongside system implementation.

   - Role transition: employees → worker-members
   - Authority transition: owners → board + members

2. **Hybrid integration planning**
   - Which existing systems integrate?
   - Which get replaced?
   - Which run in parallel?

3. **Change management planning**
   - Training needs
   - Communication plan
   - Resistance mitigation

**Deliverables**:
- Governance design for converted entity
- Integration architecture
- Change management plan

#### Phase 3: Migration Planning (Week 5-6)

**Objective**: Plan the technical and human transition

**Activities**:
1. **Data migration specification**
   - What comes over automatically
   - What requires manual entry
   - What starts fresh

2. **Parallel running plan**
   - How long do old and new systems coexist?
   - Decision rules during transition
   - Rollback criteria

3. **Training curriculum**
   - Role-based training tracks
   - "New member" orientation
   - "New director" responsibilities

**Deliverables**:
- Migration specification
- Transition timeline
- Training plan

#### Phase 4: Scope Definition (Week 7-8)

Similar to Scenario A, but with additional emphasis on:
- Migration complexity
- Change management budget
- Extended parallel running period

---

### Scenario C: Existing Co-op (Systems in Place, Room for Improvement)

**Situation**: Established co-op with existing governance systems
**Focus**: Enhancement + consolidation
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Typical client**: Co-op that's outgrown spreadsheets or has a burned-out admin

#### Phase 1: Governance Audit (Week 1)

**Objective**: Understand what works and what doesn't

**Activities**:
1. **Governance audit interviews** (30-45 min each)
   - Board/leadership, regular members, administrative roles
   - Questions:
     - "Walk me through the last decision that went well. Now one that didn't."
     - "What takes way too long?"
     - "What information can you never find when you need it?"
     - "What do you avoid doing because it's too hard?"

2. **System walkthrough**
   - Have them show you current tools
   - Watch for: workarounds, confusion, "oh we don't use that anymore"
   - Note what they're proud of vs. embarrassed by

3. **Pain point prioritization**
   - List everything that's broken
   - Stack rank by: frequency × severity
   - Top 3 become primary focus

**Deliverables**:
- Prioritized pain point list with evidence
- Current system assessment

**Red flags**:
- No one uses the existing system consistently
- Different members describe different processes

   - What's the quality?
   - Historical vs. active?

2. **Process mapping**
   - Current governance workflows
   - Where does information flow?
   - Where does it get stuck?

3. **Integration inventory**
   - What other tools does governance connect to?
   - Financial systems (Slate potential?)
   - Communication tools

**Deliverables**:
- Current state map
- Data quality assessment
- Integration opportunities

#### Phase 3: Future State Design (Week 3)

**Objective**: Design improvement, not revolution

**Activities**:
1. **Module mapping to pain points**
   - Which Co-op OS modules address which pain points?
   - What's the minimum viable improvement?

2. **Migration strategy**
   - What data comes over?
   - What starts fresh?
   - Parallel running period?
