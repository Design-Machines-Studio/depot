# BC Cooperative Association Act Requirements

> **Related sections:** → Compliance Calendar (`compliance-calendar.md`) → Bylaw Analysis (`bylaw-analysis.md`) → Red Flags (`red-flags.md`)

## Overview

The British Columbia Cooperative Association Act (SBC 1999, Chapter 28) governs all cooperatives in BC. Unlike Quebec, BC has no dedicated worker cooperative framework—worker co-ops incorporate as standard cooperatives and customize their Rules of Association.

**Key principle**: Operate on a "cooperative basis":
- Open membership
- One member, one vote
- Limited return on capital
- Surplus through patronage, reserves, or community benefit

## Formation Requirements

| Requirement | Rule | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| Minimum incorporators | 3 natural persons | All must be adults |
| Memorandum of Association | Required | Name, purpose, share provisions, capital |
| Rules of Association | Required | Membership, directors, meetings, surplus |
| Registered office | BC address required | Must be accessible during business hours |

## Membership Requirements (Part 3)

| One class of membership shares | s.48 | Mandatory | Share register |
| Voluntary membership | s.40 | Principle | Application workflow |
| Non-discriminatory admission | s.40 | Principle | Policy tracking |

### Personal Liability Trigger (Critical)

**If co-op operates with fewer than 3 members for more than 6 months:**
- Directors and officers become personally liable
- Liability covers debts incurred during that period
- Cure: Restore to 3+ members OR dissolve

**Co-op OS must track member count and alert below threshold.**

## Voting Requirements (Part 5)

### Member Voting Rights

| Special resolution | ≥ 2/3 of votes cast | s.1 definition |
| Director removal | Special resolution | s.82 |
| Bylaw amendments | Special resolution | s.45 |

**One member, one vote** — voting rights derive from membership, not shares held.

### Investment Shareholder Voting (if applicable)

| Requirement | Section | Rule |
|-------------|---------|------|

| Distance | Member must live >80km from meeting location |
| Proxy holder | Must be another member |

Model Rules default: 10% of members (inadequate for small co-ops)

| 11-25 members | 33-50% |

---

## Filing Requirements

### What's NOT Filed

Unlike business corporations:
- **Financial statements NOT filed with registrar**
- Maintained at registered office
- Distributed to members before AGM

---

## Audit Requirements (Part 8)

### The Small Co-op Burden

**BC requires mandatory audits** for most cooperatives.

Exemptions only available for:
- Community service cooperatives meeting non-profit criteria

**Worker cooperatives cannot waive audit** regardless of size—creates disproportionate cost burden.

**Ministry of Finance is reviewing** this requirement as part of multi-year Act review.

---

## Records Requirements (Part 9)

### Mandatory Records at Registered Office

| Record | Retention |
|--------|-----------|
| Memorandum and Rules | Permanent |
| Register of members | Permanent |
| Register of directors | Permanent |
| Minutes of general meetings | Permanent |
| Minutes of board meetings | Permanent |
| Financial statements | 7 years |
| Accounting records | 7 years |

### Member Inspection Rights

Members entitled to inspect during business hours:
- Memorandum and Rules
- Register of members (their own entry, or by court order for full list)
- Minutes of general meetings

## CWCF Additional Standards

The Canadian Worker Co-operative Federation sets additional standards for members:

|----------|-------------|
| Employee membership | ≥ 75% of permanent employees must be members |
| Membership opportunity | All employees must be given opportunity to join |
| Indivisible reserves | Minimum 10% of surplus allocated to reserves |

**These are voluntary standards, not BC law**, but expected for CWCF membership.

---

## Common Compliance Failures

| Issue | Consequence | Prevention |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| AGM not held in time | Court-ordered meeting | Calendar alerts |
| Annual report late | $50/day fine, dissolution risk | Automated reminders |
| Director changes not filed | Up to $5,000 fine | 14-day notification trigger |
| Fewer than 3 members | Personal liability for directors | Member count monitoring |
| No BC resident director | Filing rejection | Director residency tracking |

---

## Bylaw vs. Act Conflicts

**Order of precedence:**
1. BC Cooperative Association Act
2. Rules of Association (bylaws)
3. Policies
4. Custom/practice

**When bylaws conflict with Act:**
1. Act always wins
2. Document the conflict
3. Advise bylaw amendment
4. Configure Co-op OS to enforce Act requirements
5. Flag for legal review
