# Membership Terminology: Decolonial Alternatives

Detailed guidance for membership language — how we describe people, their journey into the cooperative, their roles, and their departure.

## The Core Shift: From Employment to Belonging

Corporate membership/employment language frames people as resources to be managed. Cooperative membership language should frame people as community members with agency, dignity, and democratic voice.

## Term-by-Term Guide

### Worker-Owner / Cooperator / Member (not Employee)

**Why it matters:** "Employee" implies someone employed by another — a power relationship. Worker-owners employ themselves collectively. "Cooperator" (Mondragon's term) emphasizes active participation in the cooperative project.

**Usage by context:**
- General UI: "Member" (simple, universal)
- Emphasizing ownership: "Worker-owner"
- Emphasizing participation: "Cooperator"
- In conversation with outsiders: "Worker-owner" (helps people understand co-op structure)
- Legal/tax documents: "Member" (per Act) or "Employee" (for CRA/tax purposes only)
- Never in internal UI: "Employee," "Staff," "Human Resources"

### Pathway to Membership / Orientation Period (not Probationary Period)

**Why it matters:** "Probation" implies suspicion — you're being watched to see if you fail. "Pathway" implies journey and growth — you're being supported toward full membership. "Orientation" implies learning and integration.

**Implementation:**
- UI label: "Orientation Period" or "Pathway to Membership"
- Status: "Orienting Member" or "Prospective Member" (not "Probationary Member")
- Milestone framing: "You're on your pathway to full membership — here's what's ahead"
- Progress tracking: Frame as achievements unlocked, not tests passed
- Legal documents: "Probationary period" if bylaws use this term; recommend bylaw amendment

### Welcome Journey (not Onboarding)

**Why it matters:** "Onboarding" is corporate HR jargon that treats people as cargo being loaded onto a ship. "Welcome journey" centers the human experience of joining a community.

**Usage:**
- UI section: "Welcome" or "Getting Started"
- Process name: "Welcome Journey"
- Communications: "Welcome to [Co-op Name]! Here's your journey into membership..."
- Practical context: "Onboarding" is fine in technical/implementation discussions; avoid in member-facing materials

### Departure / Separation (not Termination)

**Why it matters:** "Termination" is violent language — something is ended, killed, destroyed. "Departure" is neutral and dignified. "Separation" acknowledges that a relationship is changing.

**Types of departure in Co-op OS:**
- **Voluntary departure**: Member chooses to leave
- **Mutual separation**: Agreed by member and cooperative
- **Involuntary separation**: Cooperative initiates (requires due process per bylaws)
- **Retirement**: Long-term member transitions out
- Legal documents: Use whatever term the bylaws specify; recommend "withdrawal" for voluntary, "expulsion" only where Act requires

### Peer Reflection / Growth Conversation (not Performance Review)

**Why it matters:** "Performance review" implies judgment from above — a manager evaluating a subordinate. In cooperatives, accountability is mutual. Peer reflection centers collective growth.

**Implementation:**
- UI label: "Peer Reflection" or "Growth Conversation"
- Frame as: Mutual, bilateral, focused on development
- Structure: What's going well → What needs attention → Support needed → Goals ahead
- Not: Rating scales, numerical scores, rankings, stack-ranking
- Legal/tax context: If required for CRA documentation, generate compliant records from peer reflection data

### People & Culture / Member Support (not Human Resources)

**Why it matters:** "Human Resources" reduces people to resources to be extracted — a term with explicitly capitalist origins. It frames people as inputs to production.

**Usage:**
- UI section: "People & Culture" or "Member Support"
- Role: "People Coordinator" or "Member Experience Coordinator"
- Functions: Same administrative functions, different framing
- External context: "HR" is fine when communicating with external agencies that expect it

### Membership Contribution (not Buy-in / Membership Fee)

**Why it matters:** "Buy-in" commodifies belonging. "Fee" implies a transaction for service. "Contribution" frames membership as joining a collective effort.

**Implementation:**
- UI label: "Membership Contribution"
- Onboarding: "Your membership contribution of $[X] joins our collective resources"
- Payment tracking: "Contribution received" not "Payment processed"
- Legal documents: "Membership share" or per bylaws

## Member Lifecycle Language

### Stages

| Corporate Term | → Use Instead | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Applicant | **Prospective Member** | Someone exploring membership |
| Probationary Employee | **Orienting Member** | On their pathway to full membership |
| Full-time Employee | **Full Member** or **Worker-Owner** | Complete membership with all rights |
| Part-time Employee | **Associate Member** (if applicable) | Membership class per bylaws |
| Terminated Employee | **Former Member** or **Departed Member** | Relationship has ended |
| Retiree | **Emeritus Member** (if applicable) | Honored former member |

### Lifecycle Events

| Corporate Event | → Use Instead |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Hiring | **Welcoming** or **Admitting** a new member |
| Promotion | **Role transition** or **Expanded stewardship** |
| Demotion | **Role adjustment** (co-ops shouldn't have demotions — roles shift) |
| Firing | **Involuntary separation** (with due process) |
| Layoff | **Workforce adjustment** (extremely rare in co-ops; Mondragon redeploys) |
| Exit interview | **Departure conversation** or **Transition reflection** |

## Role Language

### Principles for Role Descriptions

**Describe function, not rank.** "Finance Coordinator" tells you what someone does. "Chief Financial Officer" tells you where they sit in a hierarchy.

**Use "steward" for care-based roles.** A "Records Steward" cares for the cooperative's records. A "Secretary" takes orders.

**Use "coordinator" for facilitation roles.** A "Project Coordinator" facilitates project work. A "Manager" manages people.

**Use "lead" sparingly and carefully.** "Lead" can imply hierarchy. If used, pair it with function: "Lead Facilitator" (leads the facilitation process, not the people).

### Common Role Mappings

| Corporate Title | → Cooperative Alternative |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| CEO | **General Coordinator** |
| CFO | **Financial Steward** |
| COO | **Operations Coordinator** |
| Manager | **Coordinator** or **Circle Lead** |
| Director (department) | **Domain Steward** |
| Secretary | **Records Steward** or **Keeper of Records** |
| Treasurer | **Financial Steward** or **Finance Coordinator** |
| VP | **Support Coordinator** or **Alternate Facilitator** |

## Communication Tone

### How Members Address Each Other

Avoid corporate formality. Cooperatives are workplaces of equals.

**Instead of:** "Dear Members of the Board"
**Use:** "Hey everyone" or "Circle members" or simply names

**Instead of:** "The Board has resolved that..."
**Use:** "We've decided to..." or "The stewardship circle agreed to..."

**Instead of:** "Management has determined..."
**Use:** "The operations team recommends..." or "After reviewing, here's what we think..."

### How the System Addresses Members

Co-op OS should speak to members as peers, not as subjects of administration.

**Instead of:** "Your probationary review is due"
**Use:** "Time for your next growth conversation — here's what to prepare"

**Instead of:** "Your leave request has been approved"
**Use:** "Your time away has been confirmed — enjoy!"

**Instead of:** "Performance metrics indicate..."
**Use:** "Here's how things are going..."

**Instead of:** "You are required to attend the AGM"
**Use:** "Our annual gathering is coming up — your voice matters"
