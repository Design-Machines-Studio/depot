# Financial Terminology: Decolonial Alternatives

Detailed guidance for financial language in cooperative software, reports, and member communications.

## The Core Shift: From Extraction to Relationship

Capitalist financial terminology assumes capital ownership as the basis for economic activity. Cooperative financial terminology centers labor, mutual benefit, and collective stewardship. The International Cooperative Alliance's foundational principle: capital is "a servant, not a master."

This isn't just philosophical — it has legal backing. The IRS, USDA, and cooperative legislation in most jurisdictions recognize cooperative-specific financial terminology.

## Term-by-Term Guide

### Surplus / Deficit (not Profit / Loss)

**Why it matters:** "Profit" implies extraction — value taken from labor and given to capital owners. "Surplus" describes excess payments by member-patrons that can be returned to them. Fundamentally different economic relationship.

**Legal basis:** ICA Principle 3 explicitly uses "surpluses." USDA cooperative guidelines use "net margin." The BC Cooperative Association Act refers to "surplus available for distribution." IRS recognizes "patronage-sourced income" as distinct from corporate profit.

**Usage:**
- UI label: "Surplus" / "Deficit"
- Financial statements: "Net Margin" or "Surplus" (both acceptable)
- Member communication: "Our surplus this year was $X — here's how we'll allocate it"
- Legal documents: "Net Income" or "Surplus" (per Act requirements)
- Never: "We made a profit" → Instead: "We generated a surplus"

### Patronage Refunds (not Dividends)

**Why it matters:** Dividends flow to investors based on capital invested. Patronage refunds flow to member-owners based on their use of/contribution to the cooperative. Distribution based on relationship, not wealth.

**Legal basis:** IRS-recognized term with specific tax treatment (Subchapter T in US; similar provisions in Canadian tax law). BC Act s.35 provides for "distribution of surplus."

**Usage:**
- UI label: "Patronage Refund" or "Member Distribution"
- Calculation display: "Based on your hours/patronage this year..."
- Legal documents: "Patronage Allocation" or "Surplus Distribution"
- Bridge tooltip: "Your share of this year's surplus, based on your contribution"

### Member Capital / Collective Funds (not Capital / Equity)

**Why it matters:** "Capital" and "equity" carry investment-market connotations — tradeable assets that appreciate for individual benefit. In cooperatives, member capital is pooled for collective purpose and cannot be freely traded.

**Usage:**
- UI label: "Member Capital" or "Collective Funds"
- Member's personal view: "Your Membership Share"
- Collective view: "Our Common Wealth" or "Collective Resources"
- Financial statements: "Member Equity" (standard accounting term, acceptable)
- Legal documents: "Member's Capital Account" per Act requirements

### Internal Capital Accounts (ICAs)

**Already cooperative-specific.** This term works well. In member-facing UI, consider:
- UI label: "Your Capital Account" or "Your Ownership Account"
- Tooltip: "Tracks your ownership stake — contributions you've made and surplus allocated to you"
- Avoid: Calling it an "investment account" (implies speculative returns)

### Membership Contribution (not Buy-in)

**Why it matters:** "Buy-in" frames membership as a purchase. "Contribution" frames it as joining a community and pooling resources.

**Usage:**
- UI label: "Membership Contribution"
- Onboarding: "Your membership contribution of $X helps fund our collective resources"
- Legal documents: "Membership Share" or "Initial Contribution" per bylaws
- Never: "Buy your share" → Instead: "Make your membership contribution"

### Community Benefit / Social Return (not ROI)

**Why it matters:** ROI reduces all value to financial return on financial investment. Cooperatives exist to serve member and community needs — success metrics should reflect that.

**Usage:**
- Dashboard: "Community Impact" or "Member Benefit"
- Reporting: Frame financial health alongside social outcomes
- Example metrics: "Members supported," "Living wages maintained," "Community partnerships active"
- Bridge: When funders need ROI language, provide it alongside social metrics

## Financial Statements: Where Legal Language Is Required

Financial statements filed with regulators must use standard accounting terminology. The bridge approach works well here:

**Balance Sheet / Statement of Financial Position:**
- Use standard "Assets," "Liabilities," "Member Equity" headings
- But frame the narrative: "Our collective resources" in the summary, "Assets" in the formal table

**Income Statement / Statement of Operations:**
- "Revenue" → acceptable as-is, or "Earnings"
- "Net Income" → "Surplus" (both legally acceptable for cooperatives)
- Narrative framing: "This year's surplus reflects..." not "This year's profit..."

**Statement of Member Equity:**
- Use the term "Member Equity" (accounting standard)
- Sub-labels can use cultural language: "Patronage Allocated," "Member Contributions"

## Indigenous Economic Concepts (Use With Care)

These concepts offer deeper reframing but should be used respectfully — as inspiration and parallel thinking, not appropriation.

**Ayni (Quechua — reciprocity):** Ongoing cycles of reciprocal exchange recorded in human terms. Relevant to how we frame patronage and mutual obligation. Don't use the word itself in UI unless the cooperative is Quechua-affiliated; do let the concept inform how you describe member relationships.

**Koha (Māori — reciprocal gift):** Informs sliding-scale or ability-based contribution models. "What you can give" rather than fixed prices.

**Potlatch (Pacific Northwest Indigenous — ceremonial redistribution):** Status through giving rather than accumulating. Relevant to how we frame surplus distribution — returning wealth to community, not extracting it.

**Buen Vivir / Sumak Kawsay (Andean — good living):** Replaces "wealth" with "wellbeing." Frames financial health as one dimension of collective flourishing, not the primary measure of success.

**Application principle:** Let these concepts shape your design thinking and narrative framing. Reference them in educational content with proper attribution. Don't drop indigenous terms into UI for cooperatives that don't share those cultural roots.

## Common Pitfalls

**Don't overcorrect.** "Surplus" is clear and legally sound. You don't need to invent a new word — the cooperative movement already has good ones.

**Don't make financial information harder to understand.** The goal is values-aligned language, not obscurity. If a member can't quickly understand their financial position, the language has failed regardless of how decolonial it is.

**Don't hide the money.** Anti-capitalist language shouldn't make financial realities opaque. Mario's thesis is right: "Real employee ownership requires workers understanding finances." Clarity serves democracy.

**Don't ignore accounting standards.** When preparing formal financial statements, use GAAP/ASPE terminology. Add narrative framing in cooperative language around the formal numbers.
