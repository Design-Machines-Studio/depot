# Case Studies: Organizations Implementing Decolonial & Anti-Capitalist Language

Real-world examples of cooperatives and solidarity economy organizations that have consciously addressed language in their governance, operations, and software.

## Mondragon Cooperative Corporation (Basque Country, Spain)

**Context:** Founded 1956 in resistance to Franco's fascism, when the Basque language itself was forbidden. Now 81 cooperatives, 70,000+ worker-owners, ~€11 billion revenue.

**Language choices:**
- **"Sovereignty of Labour"** — labor is primary; capital is subordinate
- **"Instrumental and Subordinate Nature of Capital"** — capital doesn't confer voting rights
- **"Payment Solidarity"** — wage equity internally and externally (max 6:1 salary ratio)
- **"Inter-cooperation"** — mutual support between cooperatives, not competition
- **"Cooperator"** — the term for a worker-owner, emphasizing active participation
- **"General Assembly"** — not AGM or shareholder meeting
- **"Governing Council"** — not Board of Directors
- **"Social Council"** — worker welfare body with no corporate equivalent
- **"Management Council"** — operational body, clearly subordinate to democratic structures

**What Co-op OS can learn:** Mondragon demonstrates that alternative terminology can operate at massive scale within legal frameworks. Their terms have legal recognition in Basque cooperative law. The key: they built the legal framework around their values, not the other way around.

## Cooperation Jackson (Mississippi, USA)

**Context:** Black-led solidarity economy initiative building economic democracy in Jackson, Mississippi. Explicitly anti-capitalist, using cooperative economics as a tool for Black liberation.

**Language choices:**
- **"Solidarity Economy"** — central framing for all economic activity
- **"People's Assemblies"** — democratic decision-making bodies
- **"Decommodification"** — removing land from speculative markets through community land trusts
- **"Mutual Aid"** — community support, explicitly not charity
- **"Economic Democracy"** — frames the work as democratic, not just economic
- Names the system: **"Racial capitalism"** — doesn't shy from identifying what they're replacing
- **"Self-determination"** — community control over economic decisions

**What Co-op OS can learn:** Cooperation Jackson shows that explicitly political language can coexist with practical cooperative operations. They don't pretend to be politically neutral. Their language names both what they're building (solidarity economy) and what they're replacing (racial capitalism). This directness builds trust and clarity.

## Loomio Cooperative (Aotearoa / New Zealand)

**Context:** Worker-owned cooperative building open-source decision-making software. Emerged from Occupy Wellington movement. ~10 worker-owners.

**Language choices (from published brand guidelines):**
- Non-gendered language: **"person"** not "guys," "them" not "he/she"
- Non-violent language: no sarcasm, put-downs, or aggressive framing
- Accessibility across sectors: language must work for community groups, not just tech companies
- Interface: **"Proposal"** not "motion" — accessible and action-oriented
- Decision options: **"Agree / Abstain / Disagree / Block"** — from Occupy hand signals
- **"Block"** has specific meaning: "I have a fundamental objection" — not casual disagreement

**Published brand values:**
- "We are friendly and approachable, not formal and stiff"
- "We prioritise clear, accurate information over spin or hype"
- "We write in a language of peers, allies and fellow humans"

**What Co-op OS can learn:** Loomio's brand guidelines are a practical model for a cooperative software content guide. Their decision language (Agree/Abstain/Disagree/Block) is simple, proven in production, and directly descended from movement practice.

## CoopCycle (European Federation)

**Context:** Federation of bike delivery cooperatives across Europe, created as a direct counter to Uber/Deliveroo exploitation.

**Language choices:**
- **"Coopyleft" license** — software can only be used commercially by cooperatives or solidarity economy organizations
- **"Federation"** — not corporation, not network
- **"Members"** — not users, not customers
- **"Uberization"** — names what they're fighting against
- **"Worker autonomy"** — central principle in all communications
- Platform framing: **"cooperative platform"** not "sharing economy" or "gig economy"

**What Co-op OS can learn:** CoopCycle demonstrates that software licensing itself can encode cooperative values. Their Coopyleft license is a fascinating model — the tool only works for democratic organizations.

## Stocksy United (British Columbia, Canada)

**Context:** Platform cooperative for stock photography, based in Victoria BC. ~1,000 artist-members, $10M+ annual revenue.

**Language choices:**
- **"Artist-members"** — not contributors, not photographers
- **"Co-op"** — in member-facing materials (not "Association" despite legal structure)
- Worked with BC Cooperative Association to **modernize language** in legal documents
- Described their process as **"removing paper-language"** while maintaining compliance
- Member communications use accessible, warm language
- Governance uses simplified meeting procedures

**What Co-op OS can learn:** Stocksy is the closest model to Co-op OS's situation — a BC cooperative that consciously bridged legal and cultural language. Their partnership with BCCA to modernize legal language is a precedent worth referencing.

## Sociocratic Organizations (Global)

**Context:** Sociocracy provides a complete alternative governance vocabulary used by organizations worldwide including nonprofits, cooperatives, and even some conventional businesses.

**Language system:**
- **"Circles"** — semi-autonomous governance units (not departments or committees)
- **"Consent"** — "no reasoned, paramount objections" (not unanimity or majority)
- **"Double-linking"** — two people connect each circle to the next, ensuring bidirectional information flow
- **"Facilitator"** — guides the process (elected by consent)
- **"Secretary"** — maintains records (elected by consent)
- **"Top Circle"** — equivalent to Board of Directors for legal purposes
- **"Aim"** — the circle's purpose (not mission statement or objectives)
- **"Proposal"** — suggested decision (not motion)
- **"Rounds"** — structured turn-taking in discussion (not debate)
- **"Objection"** — a gift to the group, information about a potential problem (not opposition)

**Compliance bridge:** Sociocratic bylaws explicitly state that "The Board of Directors shall be identical with the Top Circle" — satisfying legal requirements while making clear that actual governance follows completely different principles.

**What Co-op OS can learn:** Sociocracy offers the most complete ready-made alternative governance vocabulary. Many terms can be adopted directly. The consent model maps well to Co-op OS's decision tracking. The compliance bridge pattern (Top Circle = Board) is exactly the three-layer approach.

## Emilia-Romagna Cooperative Ecosystem (Italy)

**Context:** 5,681 cooperatives producing ~30% of regional GDP. Two-thirds of inhabitants are cooperative members. Deep cooperative culture spanning generations.

**Language and cultural norms:**
- Cooperatives are understood as **community institutions**, not businesses
- Financial language emphasizes **"mutualità"** (mutuality) — mutual benefit as the core purpose
- **"Indivisible reserves"** — surplus that belongs to the cooperative perpetually, not distributable to members (ensures intergenerational equity)
- Cooperative federations provide **shared services** — accounting, legal, HR — reducing individual cooperative's need for corporate infrastructure
- Inter-cooperation is cultural norm, not aspirational principle

**What Co-op OS can learn:** Emilia-Romagna shows that cooperative language becomes natural when it's the dominant economic culture. The concept of "indivisible reserves" — wealth that belongs to the cooperative itself and can never be extracted — is a powerful alternative to shareholder equity.

## Solid State Cooperative (British Columbia, Canada)

**Context:** Co-op development firm that explicitly centers decolonization. Incubates new cooperatives twice yearly.

**Language and approach:**
- Centers **decolonizing organizations** over strict BC Act compliance
- Prioritizes building democratic organizations for **under-represented people**
- Views the BC Cooperative Association Act as **colonial legislation** — necessary to navigate but not to internalize
- Uses cooperative structure as a tool for **self-determination**, not just business efficiency
- Recommended reading list includes Fanon, Coulthard, Grandin — explicitly political theoretical foundation

**What Co-op OS can learn:** Organizations like Solid State show how co-op development philosophy should deeply inform Co-op OS's approach. Their position — navigate the colonial legal framework without letting it colonize your organizational culture — is exactly the three-layer architecture in practice.

## Synthesis: Common Patterns

Across all case studies, successful alternative language:

1. **Emerges from practice.** Mondragon's terms came from actual workplace democracy. Loomio's came from Occupy. Cooperation Jackson's came from Black liberation organizing. None were invented by consultants.

2. **Names what it replaces.** The best alternatives don't just substitute — they explain why the old term was inadequate. "Sovereignty of Labour" doesn't just replace "shareholder primacy" — it inverts it.

3. **Works at scale.** Mondragon (70,000 people), Emilia-Romagna (2/3 of regional population), sociocracy (global) — alternative terminology scales when it accurately describes how things work.

4. **Bridges to legal compliance.** Every successful case maintains legal validity while using different internal language. The bridge pattern is universal.

5. **Is unapologetically political.** None of these organizations pretend their language choices are neutral. They're conscious decisions to build a different kind of economy.
