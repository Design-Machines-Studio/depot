# Pipeline & Pilots Reference

## Active Pipeline

Current pipeline details (specific clients, meeting dates, contact info) are stored in ai-memory. Search for relevant entity names to get the latest status.

## Distribution Channels

| Channel | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Co-op incubation pipelines | Twice yearly | New co-ops, direct distribution |
| Co-op developers | Ongoing | Bundled services |
| Provincial/national federations | Ongoing | Grants, referrals |
| Credit unions | Future | Funders AND potential clients |

## Go-to-Market: The Trojan Horse

Lead with internal operations, not public-facing design. Co-ops get funding for ops more easily. Bypasses aesthetic debates. Design language established as side effect.

## Geographic Expansion

| Market | Priority | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Canada | Primary | Active relationships |
| Australia | Secondary | Unexplored (The Co-op Federation, 208 members) |
| Europe | Future | Exploring connections |

## Pilot Success Criteria

1. Co-op actively uses governance tracking (not abandoned after 30 days)
2. Members report governance feels simpler
3. Compliance requirements surfaced, not hidden
4. At least one "I didn't know we needed to do that" moment
5. Documentable as case study
6. Generates referral to at least one other co-op

## What "Good Enough" Means for Pilot

**Doesn't need**: Full backend, all five Fixtures, Datastar real-time, mobile app, financial integration

**Does need**: Beautiful governance interface, "journey through a year" working, meeting/decision tracking, the emotional proof that governance can feel good
