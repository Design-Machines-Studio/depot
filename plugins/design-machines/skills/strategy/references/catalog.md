# DM Catalog System Reference

## Origin

Inspired by Factory Records' FAC numbering. Factory gave a FAC number to every album, poster, and lawsuit. The Haçienda nightclub was FAC 51. The system said: everything we produce is part of a body of work.

Design Machines works the same way. Every product, template, essay, talk, and tool enters a single catalog. The catalog is a timeline of output, not a filing cabinet.

## The DM Prefix

Every release gets a **DM** code with a sequential three-digit number: DM-001, DM-002, etc.

- Numbering is chronological by when something enters the catalog, not grouped by type
- DM-000 is the origin essay — the prequel release
- Codes are always public — on product pages, slides, invoices, packaging
- Printed small, monospaced, consistent position
- The code is part of the artifact, not hidden metadata

## Category Markers

Optional suffix for scanning. Four categories from factory and labor vocabulary:

| Marker | Meaning | Covers | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| /WORKS | Products & tools | Frameworks, applications, calculators | Factory works (ironworks, steelworks) |
| /PLATE | Templates & starters | Starter kits, themes, components, Figma files | Printing plates (reusable production forms) |
| /PRESS | Publications | Essays, guides, books, courses, video series | The printing press; "the press" (journalism) |
| /FLOOR | Talks & events | Conference talks, workshops, podcasts, panels | The shop floor; "you have the floor" |

Marker is always optional. DM-003 works alone. DM-003/WORKS adds clarity. The number is the canonical identifier.

## Current Catalog

| Code | Name | Category | Status |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| DM-000 | "Design Machines" essay | /PRESS | Origin · 2015 |
| DM-001 | Design Machines OÜ | Company | Active · 2024 |

## Reserved Numbers

Like Factory reserving FAC 51 for the Haçienda, significant milestones can claim a number:
- **DM-051** — First co-op running entirely on the Assembly stack
- **DM-100** — Milestone release

Storytelling device, not just bookkeeping.

## Adding New Entries

1. Assign the next sequential number
2. Determine category marker (/WORKS, /PLATE, /PRESS, /FLOOR)
3. Name per brand language guidelines (factory/labor/publishing test)
4. Record with status (Planned, Beta, Active, Origin)

## LT10 IP in the Catalog

LT10 intellectual property entering the catalog keeps its Louder Than Ten attribution. The connection between Design Machines and LT10 is an asset — it grounds the work in real operational history. Revenue distribution details are tracked in ai-memory.
