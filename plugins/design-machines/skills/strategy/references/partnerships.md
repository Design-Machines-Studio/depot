# Partnerships & Ecosystem Reference

## The Solidarity Principle

The co-op sector doesn't operate on zero-sum competition. We're all working to make the sector bigger. Partners doing great work make potential clients stronger. This solidarity is a competitive advantage against capitalist software. Their incentives fight against coordination. Ours don't.

## The Emerging Stack

| Layer | What |
|-------|------|
| Financial Foundation | Bookkeeping, cash flow, pricing tools for co-ops |
| Governance Interface | Decisions, members, equity, democracy UX (Assembly) |
| Real-time Collaboration | Live state sync, SSE for voting and dashboards |
| Design System | Typography-first CSS, editorial design (Live Wires) |

**The moat**: First integrated operating system for worker cooperatives — financial literacy + democratic governance + modern real-time collaboration — distributed through co-op incubation pipelines.

## Key Partner Roles

Current partner details (names, organizations, meeting schedules, relationship status) are stored in ai-memory. Search for partner names or "Design Machines" relationships to get the latest.

**Partner archetypes in the stack:**

- **Co-op developer / connector** — Brings in new co-ops, knows funding landscape, makes introductions
- **Financial systems specialist** — Bookkeeping and financial tools for co-ops, integration point for governance workflows
- **Framework developer** — Real-time UI technology for live voting, collaborative decisions
- **PM/ops trainer** — Process training that complements systems work

## Federation & Sector Relationships

**Provincial co-op associations** — Grant money available, referral networks, board connections.

**National co-op federations** — Broader reach, policy connections.

**International federations** — Unexplored markets (Australia: The Co-op Federation, 208 members).

**Credit unions** — They're cooperatives too. Community development mandates could fund Assembly implementations. Dual role: funders AND potential clients.

## AI / Labor Network

After conference talks on AI and labor, multiple people have expressed interest in organizing. Three engagement levels: Voice (recommended start), Connector, Builder.
