# Brand Language Reference

## The Three Worlds

Every name, code, and piece of marketing must feel like it belongs to at least one of:

1. **Factories** — how things are made
2. **Labor** — who makes them and under what conditions
3. **Publishing** — how ideas spread

If something sounds like it could come from a tech startup pitch deck, it's wrong.

## The Naming Test

Before naming anything: **Can I picture this in a factory, a union hall, or a print shop?** If yes, it fits. If it sounds like a SaaS landing page, start over.

## Existing Names and Their Logic

| Name | Source | Why It Works |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Design Machines | The thesis — tools are machines | Factory + meta |
| Live Wires | Electrical infrastructure carrying current | Factory |
| Assembly | Factory assembly + democratic assembly | Factory + Labor |
| Baseplate | Machinery mounting plate | Factory |
| Fixtures | Manufacturing jigs for specific work | Factory |
| The Northern Star | Luddite newspaper (1837–1852) | Labor + Publishing |

## Pre-Named Future Products

| Product Idea | Name | Why |
|-------------|------|-----|
| CMS starter kits | **Plates** | Printing plates. Reusable forms. |
| Live Wires design toolbar | **The Jig** | Holds work in place for precision. |
| Client risk assessor | **Red Flags** | Already called this. Labor/safety signal. |
| Co-op conversion playbook | **The Charter** | Founding document. |
| Design tokens / Figma kits | **Patterns** | Factory patterns for cutting. |
| LT10 curriculum | **The Apprenticeship** | Trade skill transmission. |

## Voice & Tone

**Sounds like**: Opinionated, political, direct, warm but honest, educational without condescension, like someone who's done the work.

**Does NOT sound like**: SaaS marketing ("revolutionize"), VC pitch ("disrupt", "10x"), corporate consulting ("synergize"), agile buzzwords, tech bro enthusiasm.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't Say | Instead |

| "Ecosystem" | "Stack" or "partnership" |
| "Dashboard" | "Workbench" or describe the view |
| "User" | "Member" or "worker" or "person" |
| "Stakeholder" | "Member" or "partner" or specific role |
