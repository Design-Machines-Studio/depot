### Polls

- Good for DM themes: workplace democracy questions, governance preferences, labor issues
- Generate substantive comments and signal topic authority

### Text Post Optimization
- Optimal length: 1,300-1,600 characters (~30-45 seconds reading time)
- First 140-210 characters visible before "see more" truncation = your hook
- Short paragraphs: 1-3 sentences each
- Liberal line breaks for mobile readability
- Maximum 1-2 emojis (strategic, not decorative)
- Personal failure stories > success stories for engagement
- Personal stories generate ~300% more engagement than generic advice

### Hashtag Strategy

- Niche hashtags drive 3.2x more engagement from relevant professionals
- PascalCase for accessibility (#DigitalMarketing)
- Emerging topics get 165% more distribution

### Timing
- Best days: Tuesday-Thursday

## Instagram Detailed Specs

### Algorithm Signals
- Watch time (primary)
- Likes per reach (strongest for existing followers)
- Sends per reach / DM shares (strongest for reaching non-followers)
- ~50% of reach from non-followers via Explore and Reels
- Average organic reach: ~3.5% of followers
- Engagement rates down 28% year-over-year
- "Your Algorithm" feature (Dec 2025): users add/remove topic categories from Reels feed
- Last 9-12 posts influence how Instagram categorizes your content

### Suppression Triggers
- Visual fingerprinting: 70%+ similarity with existing content = flagged
- 10+ reposts in 30 days = excluded from all recommendations
- TikTok watermarks: up to 72% reach reduction
- Repurposed TikTok (even without watermarks): ~42% lower reach via neural fingerprinting
- Your own logo watermark: confirmed OK by Mosseri
- Scheduling via approved third-party tools: zero penalty

### Media Specs
- Feed posts/carousels: **1080×1350px (4:5 portrait)**
- Reels/Stories: **1080×1920px (9:16)**
- Profile grid: 3:4 vertical rectangles (changed Jan 2025)
- Carousels: up to 20 slides, mixed-format (image+video) = best engagement at 2.33%
- Reels for discovery: under 30 seconds (highest completion rates)
- Reels for storytelling: 30-90 seconds
- Instagram reshows unseen carousel slides as "new content"

### Stories
- Post 1-2 daily minimum as part of core cadence
- Dimensions: 1080×1920px (9:16)
- Best for: behind-the-scenes, quick polls, process shots, low-effort authentic updates
- DM uses: Assembly development progress, Live Wires experiments, co-op conversations, Bali work-life
- Polls and question stickers feed the algorithm
- Raw and real outperforms polished production

### Caption Strategy
- First 125 characters before "more" truncation = hook
- 150-300 word captions perform well (reading time = positive signal)
- Structure: Hook → Value → CTA
- Keyword-optimized captions: ~30% more reach, 2x more likes vs hashtag-heavy
- Weave searchable phrases into captions, bio, alt text, Reel subtitles

### Hashtags (Post-Dec 2025)
- Capped at 5 per post (down from 30)
- Can no longer follow hashtags (removed late 2024)
- Function purely as categorization, not discovery
- Use 3-5 highly relevant niche hashtags
- Generic tags (#love, #instagood) = effectively useless

### Timing
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Peak: 11 AM-6 PM weekdays; 6-10 PM for deeper engagement
- Professional/intellectual content: weekday mornings 7-9 AM
- 93.5% of accounts post once a week or less → moderate consistency puts you ahead

## Bluesky Detailed Specs

### Platform Stats
- 40.2M registered users (up 302% from Sept 2024)
- ~3.5M daily active users
- Demographics: 70% under 34, 42-55% US-based
- Heavy on journalists, academics, scientists, developers, progressive political users
- Average engagement rate: 4.2% (significantly higher than X)

### Engagement Mechanics
- Default Following feed is chronological → posting time matters more
- Discover feed surfaces popular content based on network engagement
- Replies > likes for community signal (50 replies + 10 likes > 100 likes + 2 replies)
- Quote posts = powerful discovery mechanism across follower networks
- 50,000+ custom feeds built on AT Protocol — primary discovery beyond followers

### Media Specs
- Images: **1200×675px (16:9)** or **1080×1080px (1:1)**
- **1MB maximum per image** (compress to 75-80% quality)
- Up to 4 images per post in grid layout
- Video: up to 3 minutes (expanded from 60s in 2025), 100MB max, MP4/MOV
- No native carousel format — multi-image posts approximate it
- Alt text strongly expected by community

### Key Features
- **Link cards**: Paste URL → "Add Link Card" → delete raw URL text (saves characters)
- **Starter Packs**: Curated follow lists. Keep 70%+ non-promotional.
- **Custom domain handle**: @yourbrand.com replaces blue check verification (free)
- **300-character limit** per post (counts hashtags)
- Links do NOT reduce reach (major advantage over X)

### Timing
- Best: 9 AM-3 PM weekdays (strongest engagement)
- Secondary peak: 6-8 PM
- Wednesday 10 AM = single highest engagement peak
- 1-3 posts/day with active engagement between posts

## Mastodon Detailed Specs

### Platform Stats
- ~1.5M active users across 9-15M accounts
- Skews European: 27%+ German (German nonprofit origins)
- 25-34 age group = ~30-32% of users
- "Viral" threshold: 50-100 favorites (dramatically lower than corporate platforms)

### Distribution Mechanics
- No algorithm — strictly chronological
- Boosts (reposts) = ONLY distribution mechanism
- Favorites/likes do NOT distribute content
- Hashtags = only reliable discovery for non-followers
- Full-text search is opt-in (most users haven't enabled)
- Federation: posts only reach other servers via followers or relays
- Instance selection matters: larger instances = broader reach; topic-specific = better community

### Content Format
- Default: 500 characters (instance-dependent, can be 5,000+)
- Links always count as 23 characters regardless of actual length
- URL shorteners discouraged (community wants to see destinations)
- Polls natively supported (more flexible than Twitter — multi-option, multi-select)
- Video: 99MB max, 1920×1200 max resolution, transcoded to H.264 at 1300kbps, one per post
- Video recommendation: link to PeerTube/YouTube rather than native upload (resource-heavy)

### Hashtag Strategy
- 3-5 per post at footer (screen readers handle inline hashtags poorly)
- Only work on Public posts (globe icon) — Unlisted posts excluded from hashtag search
- CamelCase mandatory for accessibility (#WorkplaceDemocracy)
- Users can follow hashtags (appears in Home timeline)
- Feature up to 5 hashtags on profile to signal content areas
- More than 10 = widely viewed as spam (risk muting/blocking)
- Community ritual hashtags: #FollowFriday, #FediFriday, #Introduction

### Content Warnings (CWs)
- Expected for: politics, violence, mental health, spoilers, often long posts
- Functions like email subject line — body collapses until clicked
- Strategic: put hashtags in CW text ("Thoughts on AI labor #AIEthics #LaborRights")
- For DM's political commentary: CW use is essentially mandatory on most instances
