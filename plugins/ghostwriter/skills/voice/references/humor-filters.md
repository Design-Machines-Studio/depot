# Humor Filters Reference (via Scott Dikkers)

These are the 11 fundamental building blocks of humor from Dikkers' *How to Write Funny*. Not all are equally useful for Travis's voice. The ones marked **PRIMARY** are the go-to tools. The ones marked **SECONDARY** work in specific situations. The ones marked **USE SPARINGLY** can undermine the voice if overused.

## PRIMARY FILTERS — the core toolkit

### 1. Irony
Say the opposite of what you mean to expose the absurdity of the real thing. The intended meaning is the polar opposite of the literal meaning. This is the single most important filter for Design Machines humor. Capitalism provides endless material because the gap between what it claims and what it does is enormous.
- DM territory: "Generous CEO allows workers to keep 12% of the value they create"
- DM territory: "Company excited to announce new initiative where employees pretend to have autonomy"
- The Onion model: state something absurd as though it's perfectly normal

### 2. Parody
Mimic the form, language, and cadence of something familiar but twist the content. Travis explicitly uses this. Mimicking corporate announcements, VC pitch decks, LinkedIn hustle posts, motivational posters, HR communications, tech product launches — and making them obviously ridiculous by pushing the real logic to its honest conclusion. Parody works best when the form is instantly recognizable.
- DM territory: A fake corporate memo announcing "We've decided to let workers vote on the color of the break room walls. Democracy achieved."
- DM territory: A mock VC pitch for "a revolutionary platform that lets humans... own things together" (describing a co-op)
- The key: the parody should be close enough to the real thing that it stings
### 3. Hyperbole
Exaggerate to absurd extremes to expose the underlying truth. Push a real dynamic to its logical endpoint. Works especially well for political satire because capitalism's actual dynamics are already absurd — you just have to extend them slightly.
- DM territory: "Your employer has more control over your daily life than any government in history, but sure, let's keep calling it freedom"
- DM territory: "Productivity tip: have you tried generating all the value and keeping none of it?"

### 4. Misplaced focus
Pretend to lack awareness of the obvious and fixate on a small, insignificant detail. The comedy comes from what's being ignored. Extremely effective for exposing how people talk about work and capitalism — focusing on perks while ignoring power, celebrating culture while ignoring compensation.
- DM territory: "We know you haven't had a raise in four years but look at this new ping pong table"
- DM territory: "Great news: the company that just laid off 10,000 people won a 'Best Places to Work' award"

### 5. Analogy
Compare two unlike things to reveal a hidden truth about both. Travis already does this with metaphors. For humor, push the comparison further into absurdity while keeping the underlying logic sound.
- DM territory: "Running a company without worker input is like building a house and never asking anyone who lives there what rooms they need"
- DM territory: "Asking a CEO if workers should have ownership is like asking a landlord if tenants should own the building"

## SECONDARY FILTERS — useful in the right moment

### 6. Character
Create a comedic archetype with 1-3 clear traits and let them act on those traits. For DM, the useful archetypes are: the LinkedIn hustle bro, the clueless VC, the corporate HR rep who says "we're a family," the middle manager who confuses authority with leadership, the tech founder who thinks they invented sharing. Use these characters in parody, not as sustained bits.

### 7. Reference
Tap into common shared experiences the audience recognizes. The comedy of "everyone's been through this." For DM's audience: the meaningless all-hands meeting, the annual review that changes nothing, the Slack message from the CEO that starts with "In these uncertain times...", being told you're "not a culture fit." These land because the audience has lived them.

### 8. Shock
The unexpected turn. Strategic use of profanity, bluntness, or a sudden shift in register. For Travis this means the same thing as his profanity principle: deploy at inflection points for maximum impact, not as a constant setting. A single "bullshit" in an otherwise measured paragraph hits harder than profanity sprinkled throughout.

## USE SPARINGLY — can undermine the voice

### 9. Wordplay
Puns, double meanings, clever turns of phrase. Can be effective but risks sounding cheesy or dad-joke-ish, which is the opposite of the DM voice. Use only when the wordplay is sharp and the double meaning genuinely illuminates something. "Assembly" (factory + democracy) is good wordplay. Forced puns are not.

### 10. Madcap
Random, chaotic, absurdist humor. Mostly too silly for the DM voice. The grown-up punk energy means the humor should feel controlled and pointed, not wacky. An occasional moment of absurdism can work, but it should surprise against a backdrop of sharp, directed humor — not be the default.

### 11. Metahumor
Making humor itself the target. Commenting on the joke, the format, or the act of comedy. Can work once in a while for self-aware moments (acknowledging you're posting propaganda on Instagram, for instance), but overuse feels precious and deflates the conviction.

## How to Use the Filters in Practice

**The Dikkers process, adapted for DM:**

1. **Start with the opinion.** What do you actually think? State it plainly. "Nobody starts a co-op because they love governance." "Your boss has more power over your life than your government." "The tech industry invented cooperatives and called them DAOs."
2. **Run the opinion through 2-3 filters.** Try irony first — it's almost always productive. Then try parody or hyperbole. See which combination produces something that makes you laugh AND makes a point.
3. **Layer the filters.** The best jokes combine filters. Irony + parody: a fake corporate announcement that says the opposite of what companies actually do. Hyperbole + misplaced focus: exaggerating a trivial workplace perk while ignoring a massive structural injustice.
4. **Cut ruthlessly.** If you can remove a word without losing the joke, remove it. Dikkers: proof it to make sure no words can be removed. The tighter the joke, the harder it hits.
5. **Check the tone.** Does it punch up? Does it make the reader laugh AND think? Is it sharp without being cruel to workers? Would it make a co-op member smile and a CEO uncomfortable? Good.
