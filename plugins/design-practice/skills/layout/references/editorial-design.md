## Jan White -- Editing by Design

### The WIIFM Principle

People don't want to read. They are lazy and in a hurry. They buy publications as investors, expecting a return on money, time, and effort. They start as searchers and scrollers, always weighing the cost/benefit ratio. The "Reason For Publishing" must jump out at first glance because people examine a page for at most 2.5 seconds before turning or clicking through.

**Every layout decision must be justified by whether it helps the reader find what matters to them.**

### Three Modes of Editorial Design

**Design as Psychology** -- Use curiosity to keep readers engaged. Let captions lead from pictures to text. Create visual questions that demand answers. Hook attention with unexpected pairings and juxtapositions.

**Design as Service** -- Organize information for ease. Think for the reader through lists, infographics, sidebars, and breakout boxes. Present one point at a time. Use familiar language. Start with essential facts.

**Design as Interpreter** -- Use type contrasts and color functionally to create emphasis where it is deserved. Make the page communicate relative importance through visual weight, not just content ordering.

### The Editor-Designer Partnership

Editors and designers must bridge traditional divides. Both roles shape storytelling; neither functions effectively in isolation. Editors need to understand visual communication. Designers need to understand editorial intent. The strongest publications emerge when these roles collaborate as equals.

### Page Architecture

- **Columns and grids**: The structural skeleton
- **Margins**: Frame the content, provide breathing room
- **Captions**: The most-read element after headlines -- never neglect them
- **Covers**: The publication's face -- must communicate value instantly
- **Color**: A branding device, not decoration
- **Content chunking**: Break information into manageable units using headlines, lists, and visuals

## Francesco Franchi -- Designing News

### The Designer as Journalist

Franchi occupies both roles: graphic designer and journalist. Reporting is "telling a continuous narrative in a way that is most relevant for a broad range of traditional and digital media -- from breaking news to analysis, from interviews to commentaries, and from photo essays and illustrations to information graphics and interactive visualizations of data."

### Modular Editorial Architecture

IL magazine is composed of different sections, each with its own journalistic and graphic identity. The publication constantly reinvents itself by designing different modules for each issue. Texts, headlines, photographs, and infographics are developed together to create a visual story -- not as standalone elements.

### Infographic Thinking in Editorial

Infographics are not supplementary illustrations but primary editorial content. They operate in a hybrid communication system, merging verbal and visual elements. The design process: extraction, selection, and interpretation of data, organized into the most effective visual form combining simplicity and complexity.

### Collaborative Production

Each infographic page at IL was created by a team of three: an information designer, an illustrator, and a journalist, overseen by the creative director. This reflects the belief that editorial design requires interdisciplinary teamwork.

### Layered Communication

- Create layers of communication: hide some elements and reintroduce them later
- Create intelligent counterweight by blending quality through details and signals
- Use "big synaptic maps" providing overviews with key data points
- Draw on visual memory techniques: bold typography and strategic visual manipulation enhance audience retention

### The Core Belief

"A visual form that is as graphic as it is narrative, as entertaining as it is informative."

## Richard Turley -- Expressive Editorial

### The Grid Exists to Be Broken

Turley learned strict modular grid principles at The Guardian under Mark Porter. At Bloomberg Businessweek, he applied them as the formal skeleton. But pictures, display typography, big numbers, charts, captioning, and illustration sit completely free of the grid -- they disrupt the organization, breaking conventions to give energy and tone.

"The design and type is quite formal and boring when you really look at it -- Helvetica and a lot of strict grids and order. What sits on top is multiple crazed levels of irony, sarcasm and visual spin."

Self-assessment: "I'm a boring, traditional, formalist thinker."

### Competing Personalities as Strategy

Rather than enforcing visual uniformity, Turley encouraged designers to impose their own identities on pages: "I want people to fuck that up and to impose their own identity on the pages. That's what I have here -- a lot of competing personalities, which is something to be celebrated rather than bulldozed."

He hired hybrid talents: picture editors who illustrate, designers who create charts, everyone capable of multiple roles.

### Editorial Integration

At Businessweek, editors and designers sat side by side, aware of each other's thought processes the moment they happened. Design occupied a central role in the editorial process, not a downstream production function.

### The Anti-Design Provocation

With Civilization newspaper, Turley pushed further: "We wanted to make it hard to look at. Difficult to deal with." He rejected images almost entirely, creating a sprawling mass of text. "Friction addiction" through words.

### The Key Lesson

Mastering the grid is the prerequisite for breaking it meaningfully. Formal training enables expressive disruption. Risk-taking grounded in structure produces energy; risk-taking without structure produces chaos.

## Cath Caldwell -- Editorial Design: Digital and Print

### Editorial Design as Visual Journalism

Editorial design means "curated storytelling for those with a passion for sharing a point of view, interests or even a brand" and "is no longer bound by the rectangles of printed pages, but is increasingly available on mobile media."

### The Practitioner's Framework

| Domain | Concerns |
|---|---|
| **Format and anatomy** | Structural components: masthead, navigation, sections, departments |
| **Branding** | Visual identity unifying the publication across issues and platforms |
| **Layout creation** | Practical methods for composing pages and spreads |
| **Copy and image handling** | Integrating text and visual material effectively |
| **Digital formats** | Current and emerging digital publication formats |
| **Print-to-digital** | Seamless bridge between physical and digital editions |

### Independent Magazines

The explosion of independent publishing is a vital force in contemporary editorial design. Independent magazines demonstrate that niche audiences, high production values, and editorial conviction can sustain publications outside traditional media structures.

### Cross-Media Editorial

The strongest editorial design systems translate across print and digital while respecting the distinct qualities of each medium. Brand identity unifies; execution differentiates.

## Spread Design Principles

### Design in Spreads

Readers see left and right pages together before focusing on details. The spread is the unit of composition, not the individual page.

| Element | Left Page | Right Page |
|---|---|---|
| **Visual weight** | Secondary, supporting | Primary, attention-grabbing |
| **Eye entry** | Returns from right, scans for continuation | First point of visual contact |
| **Headlines** | Continuation, subheads | Primary headlines |
| **Images** | Supporting, context | Hero, featured |

### Pacing Across a Publication

**Micro-pacing**: Arrangement within a single spread. Balance text density with visual relief. Create clear entry points.

**Macro-pacing**: Flow across the entire publication. Structure:
- Opening spreads: high energy, visual impact
- Feature wells: immersive depth, sustained reading
- Department sections: consistent, navigable
- Transitions: breathing room between major sections

### Visual Storytelling Sequence

1. **Hook** -- the cover or opening image that creates curiosity
2. **Entry** -- the headline and deck that frame the story
3. **Orientation** -- the opening paragraph and lead image that establish context
4. **Development** -- the body text, supporting images, and infographics that deliver substance
5. **Resolution** -- the conclusion, call to action, or closing visual
