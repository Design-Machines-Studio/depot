# Identity Design Evaluation Framework

A systematic methodology for critiquing logos and identity systems, synthesized from Rand, Bass, Draplin, Wyman, and Glaser.

## The Ten-Point Evaluation

### 1. Identification Power (Rand)

**The primary criterion.** Does the mark identify?

| Test | Method | Pass |
|---|---|---|
| **Glance test** | View for 1 second, look away, recall | Can you describe it? |
| **Distance test** | View at 10% actual size | Still recognizable? |
| **Blur test** | Apply Gaussian blur | Retains basic shape? |
| **Monochrome test** | Remove all color | Still works? |
| **Inversion test** | Reverse on dark background | Still reads? |
| **Context test** | Place among competitors | Stands out? |

### 2. Conceptual Clarity (Bass)

Is there one clear idea? "Symbolize and summarize."

- Can the concept be stated in one sentence?
- Does it make you "think and rethink"?
- Is the simplicity meaningful, not empty?
- Does the mark tell the brand's story without needing explanation?

**Red flags:** Multiple competing concepts. A mark that requires a verbal explanation to understand. Complexity that doesn't serve meaning.

### 3. Reductive Rigor (Rand, Bass)

Has everything non-essential been removed?

- Could any element be deleted without losing the mark's identity?
- Are there decorative elements serving no communicative purpose?
- Does each stroke, shape, and color serve the concept?
- Is it as simple as it can be while remaining distinctive?

**Red flags:** Gradients, shadows, or effects that don't serve meaning. Ornamental elements. Excessive detail that won't survive reduction.

### 4. Systematic Extensibility (Wyman, Rand)

Does the mark seed a system?

- Can you derive a color palette from it?
- Can you derive a typographic approach from it?
- Can you derive graphic patterns or elements from it?
- Does it suggest how it should behave across applications?
- Could someone else extend the system without your guidance?

**Red flags:** A mark that exists in isolation. No clear path from mark to stationery to signage. A design that only works in one format.

### 5. Real-World Viability (Draplin)

Where will this mark actually live?

| Application | Test |
|---|---|
| **Social avatar** | Render at 48px in a circle. Still read? |
| **Favicon** | Render at 16x16. Any recognition? |
| **Business card** | Print at 25mm. All details survive? |
| **Billboard** | Scale to 3m. Proportions hold? |
| **Embroidery** | Can it be stitched? Fine lines survive? |
| **Screen print** | Can it be separated into 2--3 colors? |

**Red flags:** Fine details that disappear at small sizes. Gradients that can't be screen-printed. Complexity that requires 5+ color separations.

### 6. Cultural Resonance (Wyman, Glaser)

Does the mark connect to its context?

- Does it reflect the brand's cultural position?
- Does it speak to its intended audience?
- Is there authentic connection to place, community, or purpose?
- Does it avoid generic or borrowed visual language?

**Red flags:** A mark that could belong to any company. Cultural signifiers used without understanding. Geographic or cultural references that feel forced.

### 7. Wit and Humanity (Rand, Glaser, Draplin)

Does the mark have personality?

- Is there a moment of delight or surprise?
- Does it communicate warmth, intelligence, or confidence?
- Would you describe it as "clever" or "charming" or "bold"?
- Does it avoid corporate anonymity?

**Red flags:** A mark that provokes no emotional response. Technically correct but spiritually empty. Feels like it was generated by a committee.

### 8. Timelessness Over Trend (Rand, Bass)

Will this mark endure?

- Does it rely on current design trends? (Flat design, gradients, specific illustration styles)
- Could it have existed 20 years ago and still felt modern?
- Will it look dated in 5 years?
- Does it follow fashion or solve a problem?

**Red flags:** Trendy color choices (millennial pink, etc.). Currently fashionable illustration styles. Techniques that are popular right now but have no structural reason to exist.

### 9. Color and Typography Integrity (All)

Are color and type integral or afterthoughts?

**Color:**
- Does the palette serve the brand's personality?
- Is it limited enough to be memorable (1--3 primary)?
- Does the mark work without color?
- Are specifications defined for all media (Pantone, CMYK, RGB, HEX)?

**Typography:**
- Does the typeface reinforce the mark's character?
- Is it licensed for all intended uses?
- Does it create a coherent system with the mark?
- Is there a clear hierarchy (primary, secondary, display)?

### 10. Craft and Intentionality (All)

Is every decision deliberate?

- Are curves smooth and consistent?
- Are geometric relationships precise?
- Is spacing optically balanced (not just mathematically equal)?
- Does the presentation demonstrate the process and reasoning?
- Is there evidence of iteration and refinement?

**Red flags:** Inconsistent curve quality. Misaligned elements. Spacing that feels "off." A final mark that appears to be a first draft.

## Severity Levels

### Critical
Issues that undermine the mark's ability to function:
- Fails the blur/distance test
- Cannot work in monochrome
- No clear concept
- Technically flawed (inconsistent curves, alignment errors)

### Major
Issues that weaken the mark's effectiveness:
- Doesn't seed a system
- Relies on trends
- Fine details that won't survive reduction
- No personality or wit
- Color-dependent

### Minor
Issues that indicate room for improvement:
- Typography could better complement the mark
- Color palette could be more distinctive
- Some applications haven't been considered
- Craft details could be refined

### Stylistic
Not errors, but opportunities:
- Could benefit from a bolder color choice
- Typography pairing functional but not inspired
- System works but isn't as elegant as it could be
