# Identity Systems Thinking

How marks extend to complete identity systems across media and environments.

## The Mark Is Never the Whole Identity

A logo that doesn't seed a system is just a drawing. Every master demonstrates that the mark is merely the nucleus of a larger organism.

| Designer | Mark | System Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Rand** | IBM stripes | Horizontal stripes unify every application: stationery, signage, packaging, vehicles, publications, digital |
| **Bass** | Continental jetstream | Plane striping, uniforms, timetables, signage, ticket offices, check-in desks |
| **Wyman** | Mexico '68 letterforms | Pictograms, wayfinding, color coding, posters, apparel, merchandise, tickets, stamps, supergraphics, typeface |
| **Draplin** | DDC mark | Social media, business cards, merch, physical products, Field Notes, competitive context |
| **Glaser** | I Heart NY | Merchandise, campaigns, cultural expression, parodies, global reproduction |

## Components of an Identity System

### Primary Elements

| Component | Purpose | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Logomark** | Primary identification | Works at all sizes; works in B&W |
| **Wordmark** | Full name rendering | Typographically coherent with mark |
| **Logo lockup** | Combined mark + wordmark | Defined spacing and proportions |
| **Color palette** | Brand recognition and emotion | Primary (1--2), secondary (2--3), neutral |
| **Typography** | Voice and hierarchy | Primary typeface, secondary, display |
| **Graphic elements** | Pattern, texture, illustration style | Derived from or complementing the mark |

### Application Standards

| Application | Considerations |
|---|---|
| **Stationery** | Business card, letterhead, envelope -- the mark at intimate scale |
| **Digital** | Favicon, social avatar, email signature, website header |
| **Signage** | Environmental scale, distance readability, material constraints |
| **Merchandise** | Screen print, embroidery, dimensional limits |
| **Vehicles** | Large-scale application, motion visibility |
| **Packaging** | Shelf impact, regulatory requirements, material constraints |
| **Publications** | Consistent placement, co-branding with content |

## Clear Space and Minimum Size

### Clear Space

Define a minimum exclusion zone around the mark where no other elements may intrude. Common convention: use the height or width of a specific element within the mark as the measurement unit.

Example: "Clear space equals the height of the lowercase 'a' in the wordmark on all sides."

### Minimum Size

Define the smallest size at which the mark remains legible and recognizable. Test by actually printing/rendering at that size. Provide separate minimum sizes for:
- Print (measured in mm or inches)
- Screen (measured in pixels)
- With wordmark vs. mark only (mark-only can go smaller)

## Color System Architecture

### Primary Colors

The 1--2 colors most strongly associated with the brand. Used for the mark itself and primary brand elements.

- Must work in solid color
- Must maintain recognition in different printing processes (CMYK, Pantone, screen RGB/HEX)
- Should have sufficient contrast against both light and dark backgrounds

### Secondary Colors

Supporting colors that expand the palette for applications where primary colors alone are insufficient.

- Should complement, not compete with, primary colors
- Often include a warm and cool option for versatility
- May be used for sub-brands, departments, or categories

### Neutral Colors

Background and text colors that support the primary and secondary palette.

- A defined dark (for text and contrast)
- A defined light (for backgrounds)
- Mid-tones for secondary text and borders

### Color Specifications

For every color, define:
- Pantone (for print)
- CMYK (for process printing)
- RGB (for screen)
- HEX (for web)
- HSL (for CSS)

## Typography System

### Primary Typeface

The main typeface used for the majority of brand communications. Should be:
- Legible at body text sizes
- Available in sufficient weights (at minimum: regular, bold)
- Licensed for all intended uses (print, web, app)
- Complementary to the mark's character

### Display Typeface

Optional secondary typeface for headlines, callouts, and display settings. Should:
- Create contrast with the primary typeface
- Be distinctive without being distracting
- Work at large sizes

### System/Fallback

Define fallback typefaces for contexts where primary fonts aren't available:
- System fonts for email
- Web-safe alternatives
- Platform-specific defaults

## Responsive Identity

### Scale Variants

A modern identity system needs the mark to function at dramatically different scales:

| Context | Size Range | Considerations |
|---|---|---|
| **Favicon** | 16x16 to 32x32px | Extreme simplification; may need a symbol-only variant |
| **Social avatar** | 48x48 to 180x180px | Circle crop on most platforms; test in circle |
| **App icon** | 120x120 to 1024x1024px | Works with rounded corners; platform-specific grids |
| **Business card** | ~25mm mark width | Full lockup possible; test print at actual size |
| **Website header** | Variable | Responsive: full lockup on desktop, mark-only on mobile |
| **Signage** | 30cm to 3m+ | Distance readability; material and lighting conditions |
| **Vehicle** | Full side panel | Motion visibility; contrast against varying backgrounds |

### Responsive Logo Strategy

Define which variant to use at each scale:

1. **Full lockup** (mark + wordmark): Sufficient space, formal contexts
2. **Mark only**: Small sizes, informal contexts, repeated use where recognition is established
3. **Simplified mark**: Favicon, extreme small sizes -- reduced detail
4. **Wordmark only**: Linear spaces (website headers, email signatures)

## Brand Voice and Identity

The visual identity system should reinforce the brand's voice. This is where identity connects to the typography and layout skills:

| Brand Characteristic | Visual Expression |
|---|---|
| **Bold and confident** | Heavy mark weight, saturated color, strong type contrast |
| **Refined and restrained** | Thin lines, limited palette, generous whitespace |
| **Warm and approachable** | Rounded forms, warm colors, humanist typefaces |
| **Systematic and precise** | Geometric construction, strict grid, controlled palette |
| **Playful and expressive** | Irregular forms, varied color, hand-drawn elements |

## Environmental Identity (Wyman's Domain)

### Wayfinding Systems

When an identity extends into physical environments:

| Element | Purpose | Design Considerations |
|---|---|---|
| **Directional signs** | Guide movement | Arrow + destination; visible from decision points |
| **Identification signs** | Name locations | At entrances; readable from approach distance |
| **Informational signs** | Provide context | Maps, directories, schedules; hierarchical information |
| **Regulatory signs** | Control behavior | Universal symbols; high contrast; immediate comprehension |

### Color as Navigation

Wyman's Mexico City Metro demonstrates color as a primary wayfinding tool:
- Each transit line gets a distinct color
- Colors are culturally resonant (not arbitrary)
- Combined with iconic pictograms for each station
- Works for readers and non-readers alike

### Scalability Across Environments

An environmental identity system must work at:
- Hand-held scale (tickets, maps, guides)
- Room scale (interior signage, directories)
- Building scale (exterior signage, supergraphics)
- District scale (banners, environmental graphics, color coding)

The system's rules must be robust enough to maintain coherence across all these scales while allowing appropriate adaptation.
