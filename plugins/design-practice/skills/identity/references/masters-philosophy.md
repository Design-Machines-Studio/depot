# Masters of Identity Design

Deep profiles of the five primary influences: Paul Rand, Saul Bass, Aaron Draplin, Lance Wyman, and Milton Glaser.

## Paul Rand (1914--1996)

### The Architect of Modern Corporate Identity

"Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design is so simple that's why it is so complicated." Rand saw design as "a formal, aesthetic, and conceptual marriage of rationalism and wit." He drew from philosopher John Dewey's ideas about "functional-aesthetic perfection."

### The IBM Identity System

Not just an identity but "a basic design philosophy which permeated corporate consciousness and public awareness." The horizontal striped letterforms solved letterform imbalance while creating visual continuity across all applications. The 1981 Eye-Bee-M rebus poster demonstrated that corporate identity could embrace play: "a kind of game designed to engage the reader and, incidentally, lots of fun."

### The NeXT Presentation

Steve Jobs paid $100,000 for the NeXT identity. When Jobs asked for multiple options, Rand replied: "No, I'll solve your problem, and you'll pay me. You do not have to use the solution. If you need options, hire someone else, not me."

He delivered exactly one solution -- a black cube tilted at 28 degrees -- accompanied by a 100-page presentation book walking the reader step-by-step through the conceptual process to demonstrate the solution's "inevitability."

### The Seven Criteria

1. **Distinctiveness** -- stand out in crowded markets
2. **Visibility** -- readable from distance
3. **Adaptability** -- functions in black and white
4. **Memorability** -- simple enough for recall
5. **Universality** -- avoids cultural cliches
6. **Durability** -- remains relevant across decades
7. **Simplicity** -- removes all non-essential elements

### Key Principles

- "The principal role of a logo is to identify, and simplicity is its means."
- "A logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolises, not the other way around."
- Logos should not attempt to "tell stories" -- meaning derives from what the mark represents.
- The blur test: retain "recognizable quality even after being blurred or mutilated."
- "Systems that separate the artist from his product and create by committee diminish both the product and the maker."
- "It is in a world of symbols that man lives."
- "Simplicity is not the goal. It is the by-product of a good idea and modest expectations."
- "Don't try to be original; just try to be good."

## Saul Bass (1920--1996)

### The Reductive Master of Symbol and Motion

"Symbolize and summarize." Influenced by Gyorgy Kepes and Bauhaus philosophy, Bass emphasized simplicity and functionality over decorative elements. His guiding ethos: "deal with ordinary things in a way that allows us to understand them anew."

### On Meaningful Simplicity

"If it's simple simple, it's boring. We try for the idea that is so simple that it will make you think and rethink." This is meaningful simplicity -- distillation to essence that creates resonance, not reductiveness for its own sake.

### Notable Logos

- **AT&T (1983)**: Bell reduced to essential elements -- silhouette and circle in sky blue
- **United Airlines (1974)**: Tulip/stylized "U" capturing air travel's essence -- average lifespan: decades
- **Continental Airlines (1968)**: Dynamic jetstream logo with comprehensive identity system (planes, uniforms, signage)
- **Warner Bros. (1972)**: Modernized classic shield, maintaining heritage
- **Girl Scouts (1978)**: Three profiles symbolizing generations

**Average lifespan of a Bass logo: 34 years.**

### Methodology

- Drawing as foundation: "Learn to draw. If you don't, you're going to live your life getting around that."
- Restrained color: 3--4 colors maximum. Red, white, black as signature.
- Relentless iteration: hundreds of drafts for Kubrick
- Presentation as narrative: share enough process so the uninitiated understand the "inevitability" of the solution
- "I want everything we do to be beautiful. It's the way I want to live."

## Aaron Draplin (b. 1973)

### The Bold Functionalist

Design philosophy rooted in bold simplicity, functional honesty, and deep reverence for mid-century American graphic design. Clean lines, bold colors, typography that communicates with clarity. Good design serves a purpose beyond aesthetics -- it should work.

### The Thick Lines Philosophy

Discovered while working on the All Tiny Creatures record (2011), experimenting with simple vector shapes all lined with a consistent thick line. "Pretty powerful, with an odd uniformity that was striking and almost Utopian in feel." Thick black lines delineating neon or sunset-colored shapes.

### Process

1. **Discovery**: Natural conversation with clients (no formal questionnaires)
2. **Sketching**: Pencil and paper first -- "your hand is free-er than in Illustrator"
3. **Digital refinement**: Adobe Illustrator with emphasis on geometric structure
4. **Abundance**: Presents 60--120+ variations, creating a funnel for client discovery
5. **Contextual display**: Logos in real environments, not floating on white
6. **Competitive contrast**: Analyze the landscape, then deliberately differ

### Merch Thinking

Design with real-world application in mind from the start. Field Notes memo notebooks embody this: functional, nostalgic, iconic objects where design lives on a physical product. Consider where logos actually appear in physical and digital worlds.

### On Work

- "I work hard. And, I do this stuff for fun, way more than for a buck."
- "I'm not designing for me, I'm designing for this person."
- "THEY HIRED ME. GET THE JOB DONE. MAKE THEM LOVE IT!"

## Lance Wyman (b. 1937)

### The Environmental Systematist

"Designing an image that could communicate an idea in a systematic and spatial way: a universal, visual language." Core belief: "Graphic design is all about telling stories, but visual stories."

### Mexico '68 Olympics

Won the competition at age 29. The identity wove Op Art, pre-Columbian geometry, and modern typography into a comprehensive system:

- Logo geometry: Olympic rings generated the numerals 6 and 8; the three-lined structure evolved into letterforms for "Mexico" and an entire typeface
- System scope: pictograms, wayfinding signage, color coding, posters, apparel, merchandise, tickets, stamps, supergraphics
- Cultural integration: vibrant colors, bold patterns, symbolic richness from indigenous geometry and ancient symbols -- without appropriating or patronizing

### Mexico City Metro (1969)

With one-third of Mexico's population unable to read, Wyman developed a system combining color and visual motifs in pictograms. Each station identified by a meaningful icon -- a visual mnemonic drawing on local history, monuments, or neighborhood functions. (Chapultepec station uses a grasshopper because in Aztec, Chapultepec means "grasshopper hill.")

### Methodology

- Deep cultural research before any design begins
- Immersive observation: ride alongside beat cops, discuss crowd management with security guards, interview bartenders
- "A unique dialogue with the sociocultural context that envelops his projects"
- Symbol-based communication crossing language barriers
- Systems thinking applied holistically across all touchpoints

## Milton Glaser (1929--2020)

### The Humanist Expressionist

"Just enough is more." Challenged Mies van der Rohe's "Less is more" as "total nonsense" and "an absurd proposition." Argued that examining a Persian rug shows every part is essential for aesthetic success.

Design must be "both functional and poetic," with the designer serving as "a bridge between commerce and culture."

### I Heart NY (1977)

Created during New York City's economic and social decline. Capital "I" and red heart stacked on "NY" in American Typewriter. Conceptual clarity -- one powerful emotion, immediately felt -- trumps visual complexity. One of the most reproduced marks in history.

### Push Pin Studios

Co-founded with Seymour Chwast in 1954, deliberately rejecting "the sterile Swiss Modernism dominating corporate America" to "inject humanity back into commercial art." Work "infused with warmth, character, and wit."

### Brooklyn Brewery

When founders wanted to name it "Brooklyn Eagle," Glaser responded: "Why sell a bird when you've got the whole borough?" The logo evokes the Dodgers while remaining fresh, "boiling down all the images" into "an elegant, simple way."

### Ten Things I Have Learned

1. Only work for people you like
2. If you have a choice, never have a job
3. Some people are toxic; avoid them
4. Professionalism is not enough -- "the continuous transgression" is required
5. Less is not necessarily more -- "Just enough is more"
6. Style is not to be trusted
7. How you live changes your brain
8. Doubt is better than certainty
9. It does not matter what you think
10. Tell the truth

### Key Quotes

- "To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master."
- "There are three responses to a piece of design -- yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for."
