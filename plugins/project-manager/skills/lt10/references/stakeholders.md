> **Related sections:** → Communication Scripts (`scripts.md`) → Change Control (`change-control.md`) → Risk Management (`risk.md`)

## Stakeholder Types

### Internal vs External

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Internal** | People in your organization | Team members, executives, contractors (treat as internal for cohesion) |
| **External** | People outside your organization tied to project | Client POC, their team, customers, investors |

### Proximity to Project (Primary/Secondary/Tertiary)

| Level | Internal | External | Distance from Day-to-Day |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Primary** | You + immediate project team | Client POC + their core team + customers | Closest, most vocal |
| **Secondary** | Boss, owners, executives, board | Client's bosses, executives, VPs | Financial stake, less involved |
| **Tertiary** | Advisors, consultants, regulatory | Advisors, investors, regulatory boards | Furthest, but huge impact |

### Watch-Outs by Level

| Level | Watch For |
|-------|-----------|
| **Primary** | Misaligned contractors, drama, hiding creep from PM |
| **Secondary** | Swoop and poop, poor estimating by optimistic leaders, favors agreed above |
| **Tertiary** | Mystery voices demanding action, sudden direction changes, massive delays |

## Stakeholder Alignment

**Definition:** Everyone pulling in same direction, fighting for same things, uniting for same purpose.

**Stakeholder misalignment is one of the biggest predictors of project failure.**

### What to Align On

- Goals
- Priorities (importance over urgency)
- Agreement on project roles and involvement
- Process and communication channels
- Brand aesthetic understanding
- Audience needs
- Actions and behaviors
- Trust and respect

### Signs of Misalignment

- Fighting, contradicting, disagreeing
- Massive delays
- Stakeholders go "dark" then pop up months later
- Numerous extension requests
- Sudden direction or scope changes
- Conflicting feedback
- Multiple revision rounds
- Awkward meeting behaviors
- Passive aggressive or defiant behavior

### When Misaligned - STOP

1. Address situation immediately - cannot push to finish line if forces pulling opposite directions
2. Ask if they feel aligned on goals/outcomes
3. Remind of goals outlined at kickoff
4. Ask if goals still relevant (changes affect scope/budget)
5. Remind most projects fail from misalignment
6. State you cannot move forward until aligned
7. Ask how much time needed, set firm date

### Pause Clause

> "If any sign-off, deliverable, approval, turnaround, or payment is late, pause project and restart based on availability."

### Squeaky Stakeholder Tip

Loudest stakeholders often feel excluded from decision-making. Ask: "What's most important to get right? What input/approval do you need?"

## Stakeholder Scripts

**When stakeholders are misaligned:**
> "I'm sensing we might not be on the same page about [X]. Before we continue, can we step back and confirm we all agree on the goals and priorities?"

**When a stakeholder goes dark:**
> "I haven't heard from you in [X weeks] and want to make sure everything's okay. Are there concerns I should know about? I'd rather address them now than have them surface later."

**When feedback is contradictory:**
> "I'm getting different direction from [person A] and [person B]. Can we get everyone in a room to align before I proceed? I want to make sure we're building what you actually want."

**When someone is being difficult:**
> "Help me understand your concern. What would need to be true for you to feel good about this direction?"

**When you need to address the elephant in the room:**
> "I want to name something I'm observing: [specific behavior/pattern]. Is there something going on I should know about?"

**When delivering bad news:**
> "I need to share some difficult news. [State issue clearly.] Here's what I recommend we do about it. [Proposed solution.]"

**When you made a mistake:**
> "I made an error on [X]. Here's what happened and here's my plan to fix it. I apologize for the impact."

## Empathy Maps

Tool for understanding stakeholder perspectives:

| Aspect | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **See** | What do they observe in their environment? |
| **Hear** | What influences come from colleagues, bosses, media? |
| **Think and Feel** | What are their fears, frustrations, hopes? |
| **Say and Do** | What behaviors do they exhibit? |
| **Gain** | What do they want to achieve? |
| **Fear Losing** | What are they afraid of losing? |

Use for initial stakeholder assessments and scripting responses to tricky stakeholders.

## RACI Chart

For each deliverable/decision:

| Role | Definition | Rule |
|------|------------|------|
| **R**esponsible | Does the work | Can be multiple |
| **A**ccountable | Final decision authority | Only ONE per item |
| **C**onsulted | Provides input before decision | Ask for feedback |
| **I**nformed | Notified after decision | Keep in loop |

### Alternative: Voice/Veto/Vote

- Who has a **voice** on the project
- Who gets to influence direction (**vote**)
- Who has **veto** power

---

## Communication Styles

| Style | Traits | How to Work With |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Director** (Intuitive) | Aggressive, strong-willed, no time for frivolity | Start with high-level overview, clear summaries, solutions |
| **Thinker** (Analytical) | Methodical, needs time to process, appears quiet | Give processing time, explain impact on goals |
| **Relator** (Personal) | Wants to please, seeks approval, emotive, avoids conflict | Warmth, support, help with decisions |
| **Socializer** | Energetic, likes people, lacks filter, wants inclusion | Clear boundaries, focused goals |

**Assertive communication** is best for healthy relationships. Avoid aggressive, passive-aggressive, manipulative, or passive styles.

## Communication Channels

### By Touch Level (low → high)

Letters/docs → Email → Text/IM → Phone → Video → Face-to-face

### Increase Touch When

- Trust is broken
- Something goes wrong unexpectedly
- You/team screws up
- Delivering bad news
- Major miscommunication
- Someone drops the ball
- Major project changes
- Lacking clarity on direction

---

## Team Communication Agreements

Social contract defining:
- How you'll communicate
- How soon
- With whom
- In what style and format

Makes unspoken nuances visible. Reduces blameshifting and accountability-skipping.

---

## Stakeholders and Change

People respond to change like Kubler-Ross grief model:

**Denial → Anger → Fear → Bargaining → Depression → Acceptance**

Go easy on folks - change is tough and takes time. This applies to internal process changes too.

---

## Communication Plan Template

| Stakeholder | Information Needed | Frequency | Channel | Owner |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Sponsor | Status, risks, budget | Weekly | Email + call | PM |
| Client team | Progress, blockers | Daily/weekly | Slack/Standup | PM |
| Dev team | Requirements, priorities | Daily | Standup | Lead |

---

## Alignment Warning Signs

- Stakeholders adding requirements at review meetings
- Conflicting direction from different stakeholders
- Delayed approvals or feedback
- "I thought we agreed..." conversations

---

## Stakeholder Onboarding

### Expectations to Clarify

With stakeholders, be clear about:
- What you expect for their involvement and behavior
- Format and channels for communication
- When you are available and when not
- How many revisions are included
- How external stakeholders should communicate with team

### Define the Fire Route

What should stakeholders do when things go wrong?

Answer these questions early:
1. How should things work?
2. How will we know if they are/aren't working?
3. What are next actions if something is wrong?
4. Who needs to be aware?
5. What is the best format for that communication?
6. How do we know we've addressed the problem?
7. How do we reinforce relationship after problem solved?

### Consistency Principle

**Changes to processes or expectations shake trust.** They prevent stakeholders from automating behavioral patterns, causing fatigue and irritation.

Have clear idea of goals, behaviors, and outcomes before reaching out. Refine success criteria with stakeholder buy-in.

---

## Setting Pace and Tone

PM is a **customer relationship manager** for every stakeholder once the project begins.

### Communication Style Elements

- Speaking speed (slowing down creates tranquility)
- Communication length (shorter is always better)
- Jargon (avoid abbreviations, explain necessary terms)
- Posture (relaxed shoulders, open chest, stand tall)
- Eye contact (holding gaze shows power and interest)
- Nonverbal cues

**Model the communication style you want back from stakeholders.**

Pay attention to cultural differences - "your way" isn't always best.
