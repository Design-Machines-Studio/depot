## How Your Company Spends Money

### Expense Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Operational expenses** | Occur regardless of sales | Rent, salaries, utilities |
| **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** | Used up with each sale | Materials, contractor fees |

More people = greater expenses. Monthly expense outflow = **burn rate**.

### Profit Margin Benchmarks

| Margin | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| 5% | Weak |
| 11-20% | Average |
| 25-30% | Profitable agency |

---

## Burn Rate Calculation

```
Monthly Burn Rate = Annual Expenses ÷ 12
Per-Employee Cost = Annual Expenses ÷ Number of Employees
```

**Example:**
- $1,200,000 annual expenses ÷ 12 = **$100,000/month burn rate**
- $1,200,000 ÷ 8 employees = **$150,000 expenses per employee/year**

---

## How Your Company Makes Money

### Client Services Model

- Depends on project revenue (erratic, unpredictable)
- Need enough active projects to overcome burn rate
- **Have 15% more prospects than capacity** (Joe Rinaldi)
- Collect money frequently to keep bank balance high

**Key insight:** Blowing deadlines hurts profitability MORE than going over hours. Expenses drain even when revenue isn't flowing.

## High Value vs High Quantity Clients

### Fewer High-Value Clients is Better

| Benefit |
|---------|
| Less context switching |
| More attention to each project |
| More freedom for experimentation |
| Less handholding |
| Higher work quality |
| Better margins and referrals |
| Happier team |

**Track:** Number of clients AND value of each client

**Example:** $1.2M/year = 10 × $120K clients OR 20 × $60K clients. Which takes more PM effort?

## David Baker's Revenue Distribution

| Rule | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| Maximum single client | <25% of revenue (ideally <15%) |
| Minimum single client | >5% of revenue |
| Sweet spot | 5-15% each client |

---

## Positioning for Bigger Projects

- Position for clients you WANT, not ones you have
- Make goals known in messaging and positioning
- Predetermine discount thresholds (e.g., max 15%, apply to second project not first)
- Avoid one-off and low-value projects
- Only show work from great projects (the work you do brings in more like it)

---

## Annual Revenue Target Calculation

```
Average Salary × 2 = Revenue per Full-Time Employee
Revenue per FTE × Number of Employees = Annual Revenue Target
```

**Example:**
- $80,000 × 2 = $160,000 revenue per FTE
- $160,000 × 10 employees = **$1,600,000 annual target**

---

## Rate Calculations

### Monthly Rate

```
Annual Revenue ÷ 12 ÷ Billable Employees ÷ Target Client Load = Monthly Rate/Person
```

**Example:** $1,600,000 ÷ 12 ÷ 8 ÷ 3 = **$5,555/month/client/person**

### Sprint/Week Rate

```
Annual Revenue ÷ Working Weeks ÷ Billable Employees ÷ Client Load = Week Rate
```

**Example:** $1,600,000 ÷ 48 ÷ 8 ÷ 3 = $1,388/week (×2 = **$2,776/sprint**)

### Day Rate

```
Annual Revenue ÷ Working Weeks ÷ Billable Employees ÷ 5 = Day Rate
```

**Example:** $1,600,000 ÷ 48 ÷ 8 ÷ 5 = **$833/day/person**

### Hourly Rate (Avoid When Possible)

```
Annual Revenue ÷ Working Weeks ÷ Billable Employees ÷ Billable Hours = Hourly
```

**Example:** $1,600,000 ÷ 48 ÷ 8 ÷ 30 = **$139/hour** (minimum)

## Estimating Units vs Billing Units (Critical Distinction)

**This is one of the most important pricing concepts in LT10.**

| Unit | Use For ESTIMATING | Use For BILLING |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Days** | ✅ Yes - primary estimating unit | ❌ No - not for client billing |
| **Sprints/Weeks** | ⚠️ For project length only | ✅ Yes - primary billing unit |
| **Monthly** | ❌ No - too coarse | ✅ Yes - retainers, maintenance |
| **Hourly** | ❌ No - too granular, anxiety-inducing | ❌ Avoid - only for legal requirements |

### Why This Matters

- Days are accurate for task-level scoping (0.25, 0.5, 1 day increments)
- But days as a billing unit invites nickel-and-diming and scope disputes
- Sprint/week billing creates natural buffer and smoother cash flow
- Sprints align with agile development cycles clients understand

### Example Workflow

1. **Estimate internally:** Discovery (3 days) + Design (8 days) + Revisions (5 days) = 16 days
2. **Convert to sprints:** 16 days ÷ 5 days/week = 3.2 weeks ≈ 2 sprints (with buffer)
3. **Present to client:** "This project is 2 sprints at $X/sprint = $Y total"

**What the client sees:** "2 sprints, $17,000"
**What you track internally:** 16 estimated days across specific tasks

## When to Use Each Rate Type

| Rate | Good For | Not Good For |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Monthly** | Retainers, maintenance, forecasting, goal setting | Billing project work, tracking small tasks |
| **Sprint/Week** | **Presenting final estimates to clients**, scoping project length, capacity planning, agile work | Task-level scoping, big picture planning |
| **Day** | **Internal task-level estimating**, very short projects, bug fixes | Billing clients, estimating project length |
| **Hourly** | Legal requirements (grants, govt), sometimes bug fixes | Almost everything else - makes you anxious |

**On hourly rates (from the curriculum):**
> "What it's good for: Making you anxious."

Avoid hourly billing. If required (grants, government), calculate it but don't lead with it.

---

## Project Management Overhead

- **PM should be 15% minimum** of project budget
- Billable people must cover non-billable overhead
- Non-billable roles (sales, admin, execs) need revenue generated for them
- Can create 2:1 or higher ratio of billable to non-billable

---

## Assessing Client Size

### Clients Too Small

- More PM effort required
- More blown deadlines and delays
- Most vocal, value your time least
- Pull you from company goals
- Pattern repeats - gaps need filling

### Clients Too Big

- Disastrous when they leave (layoffs)
- NDA may prevent showing work
- Burnout and boredom from one project too long

### Clients Just Right

- Evenly distributed revenue = stability
- **Optimal: 10-15 active clients** regardless of org size
- Client revenue should be 7-10x yours

---

## How PMs Support Healthier Revenue

1. **Review pricing approach** - set minimum client value targets
2. **Vet incoming leads** - ensure alignment, assess risk
3. **Adjust billing cycle** - bill on regular cadence, not milestones
4. **Strengthen relationships** - trust = ongoing work (Customer Lifetime Value)
5. **Schedule intuitively** - start projects on regular schedule (e.g., first Tuesday of month)
6. **Boost focus time** - team needs 3 hrs/day minimum; meeting-free days
7. **Smarter resourcing** - max 3 projects/person/week; don't pull resources mid-project

---

## Project Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Value-based** | Priced on value delivered, not time/effort. Win-win but harder to sell. Must understand costs to be profitable. |
| **RFPs/Bids** | Avoid if possible. High effort, low win rate. If winning <30%, question why you're doing them. |
| **Fixed/Flat rate** | Clear budget/timeline. Great with clear change handling. Risk of burnout without it. |
| **Flexible/Variable** | T&M, Agile sprints. Most comfortable for agencies. Allows course correction. |
| **Non-billable** | Internal projects, pro bono, strategic work. |

## Preventing Scope Creep from SOWs

### The Problem

**98% of firms badly underestimate projects.** (David Baker, Recourses)

What happens:
1. Loosely defined project gets cemented in SOW with minimal team input
2. Client holds org accountable to requirements
3. Team hasn't done adequate research
4. Project changes 100% of the time
5. Scope grows, schedule stretches
6. Team bleeds revenue trying to hit moving target

**The problem:** SOW locks in fixed price AND fixed schedule = iron triangle with three fixed sides.

### Solutions

**1. Do homework, make business case**
- Collect data on original scope/estimates vs actuals
- Show how Scope A turned into Scope B
- Show overtime being worked

**2. Reduce scope and lock it down**
- Say "no" or "yes, and it will cost X more"
- Reference SOW when pushback comes
- "Let's add that to phase two list"

**3. Use flexible language in contracts**
- "Final deliverables outlined after research"
- "Payments monthly" (not when deliverables sent)
- "Mandatory review of scope after research"
- "Two rounds of revision included"

**4. Constrain to Discovery phase**
- Sell research portion only first
- Lower risk - outcomes are findings, not production
- Walk away if unhappy before larger contract

---

## Flexible vs Vague Language

**Vague (bad):** "We'll test in all the latest browsers"
- Unclear which browsers
- No plan for extras

**Flexible (good):** "We'll determine which browsers your audience uses and prioritize testing for 80% of this base. Additional browsers can be negotiated separately."
- Clear criteria
- Room to negotiate
