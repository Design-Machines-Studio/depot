# LT10 Communication Scripts

Ready-to-use scripts for common PM situations. These are embedded throughout the main SKILL.md but collected here for quick reference.

---

## Estimation & Pricing

### When asked for quick estimates
> "I can give you a rough order of magnitude now, but I'll need to consult with the team for a confident estimate. The ROM is [X], but it could be higher."

### When presenting an estimate
> "Based on the scope and what I know about how we've worked together, I'm estimating **[X days]** (~$[amount]). The range could be as low as [low] if feedback is fast, or as high as [high] if we hit complications. Here's why I'm landing toward the [higher/lower] end: [list red flags]."

### When estimates are challenged
> "This estimate includes buffer for the unknowns we've identified. If we reduce it, we're accepting more risk of overrun. Are you comfortable with that trade-off?"

### When timeline pressure mounts
> "I understand the urgency. Here are our options: reduce scope, add resources, or extend the timeline. Which constraint can we flex?"

### When sharing confidence levels
> "We're 50% confident we can deliver in [shorter time], but we're 90% confident we can in [longer time]."

---

## Scope & Change Control

### When a new request comes in
> "Got it. Let me check with the team on how this impacts our timeline and budget. I'll get back to you by [date]."

### When scope creep appears
> "I'll check with the team on impact. This may add time and budget—are you okay with that?"

### When you need to say no
> "This is a great idea for the future. Let's add it to the backlog for phase two so we can stay focused on our current goals."

### When scope is clearly expanding
> "This would add [X days/dollars] to the project. Do you want me to quote it as an addition, or should we swap it for something in the current scope?"

### When someone says "Can you just..."
> "There's no such thing as 'just' in project work. Let me estimate what this actually involves and get back to you."

### When change is out of scope
> "This is outside our agreed scope. I can quote it as an addition—it would be approximately [X days/$X]. Want me to proceed with a formal quote?"

### When pushing back on a change
> "I understand why you want this, but adding it now would [delay launch by X / require cutting Y / cost Z more]. Is that trade-off worth it, or should we defer to phase two?"

### When you need written approval
> "Before we proceed with this change, I need written confirmation that we're adjusting the [timeline/budget/scope]. Can you reply confirming this is approved?"

### When someone tries to sneak scope in
> "This feels like a scope addition rather than a clarification. Let me estimate the impact and we can discuss whether to include it."

### Defending the timeline
> "If we add this now, we'll need to either extend the deadline by [X] or remove [Y] from the current scope. Which works better for you?"

---

## Stakeholder Management

### When stakeholders are misaligned
> "I'm sensing we might not be on the same page about [X]. Before we continue, can we step back and confirm we all agree on the goals and priorities?"

### When a stakeholder goes dark
> "I haven't heard from you in [X weeks] and want to make sure everything's okay. Are there concerns I should know about? I'd rather address them now than have them surface later."

### When feedback is slow
> "I haven't heard back on [X] and it's blocking progress. Can we get 15 minutes to review?"

### When feedback is contradictory
> "I'm getting different direction from [person A] and [person B]. Can we get everyone in a room to align before I proceed? I want to make sure we're building what you actually want."

### When someone is being difficult
> "Help me understand your concern. What would need to be true for you to feel good about this direction?"

### When you need to address the elephant in the room
> "I want to name something I'm observing: [specific behavior/pattern]. Is there something going on I should know about?"

### Squeaky stakeholder
> "What's most important to get right? What input or approval do you need to feel good about this?"

### Setting expectations at kickoff
> "My job is to give you realistic timelines and budgets, even when the news isn't what you want to hear. I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver than the reverse."

---

## Executive Management

### Swoop and poop defense
> "That's interesting feedback. Before we change direction, let me assess how this impacts our timeline, budget, and current goals. Can we meet tomorrow once I've had a chance to evaluate?"

### Middle manager filtering
> "I want to make sure I understand the full context. Would it be helpful if we included [executive] in our next review to confirm we're aligned on direction?"

---

## Difficult Conversations

### Delivering bad news
> "I need to share some difficult news. [State issue clearly.] Here's what I recommend we do about it. [Proposed solution.]"

### When you made a mistake
> "I made an error on [X]. Here's what happened and here's my plan to fix it. I apologize for the impact."

### Escalating issues
> "This has escalated beyond what I can resolve at my level. I need to bring in [person/team] to help us find a path forward."

### When hope creep is happening
> "I'm concerned we're not being realistic about the timeline. Can we look at what's actually left and adjust expectations now rather than miss the deadline?"

### Addressing missed deadlines
> "We missed the deadline on [X]. No blame—let's understand what happened so we can adjust our approach going forward."

---

## Team Communication

### When team is overloaded
> "I'm seeing signs of overload. Let's look at the priorities and see what can be deferred or reassigned."

### When quality is slipping
> "I'm noticing [specific issue]. What's blocking us from meeting our quality bar? What do you need from me?"

### Protecting team capacity
> "The team is at capacity right now. If this is urgent, we'll need to deprioritize something else. What should that be?"

---

## Capacity & Scheduling

### When you need to defer work
> "I'd love to work on this, but I'm at capacity until [date]. Can we kick off then? If timing is critical, I can recommend another resource."

### When asked to take on too much
> "Taking this on would mean deprioritizing [X] or working at an unsustainable pace. Which would you prefer, or can this wait until [date]?"

---

## Meeting Management

### Starting a meeting
> "We have [X] minutes. Our goal today is [specific outcome]. Let's make sure we leave with [decision/action items]."

### Keeping meetings on track
> "Great point—let's capture that for a separate discussion. For now, let's stay focused on [agenda item]."

### Ending a meeting
> "To summarize: we decided [X], and the next steps are [Y]. I'll send notes within 24 hours."

### Declining a meeting
> "I don't think I'm the right person for this meeting, but I can [suggest alternative]. If you do need me, can you share the agenda so I can prepare?"

---

## Client Communication

### Explaining methodology choice
> "Given your fixed budget and deadline, we'll structure this in phases with clear milestones. Within each phase, we'll work in two-week sprints so you can see progress and we can adjust priorities based on what we learn."

### Rejecting a request
> "After looking at the data/schedule/scope/budget, I don't think it makes sense to do X. Do you want to talk about other options?"

### Clarifying vague feedback
> "When you say X, do you mean this or [explanation]? Thanks for clarifying."
