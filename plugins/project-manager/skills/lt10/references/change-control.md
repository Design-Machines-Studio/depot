> **Related sections:** → Scoping (`scoping.md`) → Stakeholders (`stakeholders.md`) → Risk Management (`risk.md`)

## What Is Change Control?

The process of minimizing disruptive changes that impact team, stakeholders, goals, outcomes, timelines, scope, and estimates.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Change control** | Preventing unnecessary disruptive changes |
| **Change management** | Embracing and responding to changes that will happen |

---

## Process Flow

1. **Establish:** Onboard stakeholders on feedback process, revision rounds, deadlines
2. **Gather:** Collect change requests through defined channels
3. **Triage:** Assess priority (critical/medium/low), type (bug/feature/improvement), scope (in/out)
4. **Process:** Assign, schedule, implement, verify

---

## Types of Change Requests

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Change request** | Declarative statement of what should change (e.g., "make logo bigger") |
| **Bug report** | Error, flaw, failure—behaves differently than intended |
| **Feedback/comment** | Vague response with no clear request |
| **Revision** | Changes made in response to request |
| **Approval** | Written confirmation to move forward |

---

## When Feedback Becomes Change Request

Ask yourself:
- Is this a request to change something?
- Is this an idea or suggestion?
- Is this a requirement?
- Is it important or a distraction?
- What info do I need before acting?

---

## The Learning Curve

You learn the most about project requirements during the first half. The more you build, the less freedom to make changes later. Race to fail fast and learn as much as possible early.

## Change Cycles by Methodology

### Waterfall: Phase-Based Revisions

- Strategy revisions (rounds 1-2)
- Design revisions (rounds 1-2)
- Development revisions (rounds 1-2)
- QA revisions (rounds 1-2)
- Final review

### Agile: Sprint-Based

- Sprint 1: enhancements, bug fixing, release
- Sprint 2: enhancements, bug fixing, release
- Continuous through project

## Change Response Strategies

| Response | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Apply immediately** | Four-alarm fires, life threatening, project destroying, OR amazing value improvements |
| **Triage and prioritize** | New features, additional functionality, most bugs |
| **Stop and evaluate** | Process/org changes, goal shifts, stakeholder changes, major timeline/budget shifts |
| **Reject** | Frivolous requests, bad ideas that hurt stakeholders/audience/planet |
| **Defer** | Future phase items, minor bugs, enhancements that can wait |

---

## Sources of Change

| Source | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Internal team** | New ideas, pivots, new hires, process changes |
| **External stakeholders** | Feedback, new requirements, new contacts |
| **External world** | Regulations, competition, market shifts |
| **Technology** | New tools, integrations, security updates |

## Managing Your Change Control System

### 1. Establish and Clarify the Process

- Onboard stakeholders at project start
- Explain revision rounds (recommend 2-3 per phase)
- Set windows and deadlines for feedback
- Define consequences for late turnarounds
- Talk openly about process throughout

### 2. Gather Feedback and Requests

- Batch small/simple changes
- Review with right folks daily/weekly
- Immediately categorize unexpected changes

### 3. Triage Feedback and Requests

- Determine who best to triage
- Determine priority (critical, medium, low)
- Determine type (bug, new feature, improvement)
- In scope or out of scope? Now or later?
- Estimate time/budget needed
- Notify stakeholders of decisions

### 4. Process Feedback and Requests

**If processing now:**
- Gather additional context
- Assign to team members
- Work into upcoming week/sprint
- Review internally
- Have stakeholder approve
- Get written approval

**If processing later:**
- Notify stakeholders
- Move to Ideas/Backlog column
- Revisit when time

**If rejecting:**
- Batch rejections
- Hop on call to discuss
- Provide clear business case
- Bring in experts to support if needed

## Swoop and Poop Defense

When executives unexpectedly drop feedback that could derail the project:

1. Press pause—don't react immediately
2. Evaluate impact on budget and timeline
3. Request written documentation of change
4. Present options with trade-offs
5. Get explicit approval before proceeding

**Script for swoop and poop:**
> "That's interesting feedback. Before we change direction, let me assess how this impacts our timeline, budget, and current goals. Can we meet tomorrow once I've had a chance to evaluate?"

**Script for middle manager filtering:**
> "I want to make sure I understand the full context. Would it be helpful if we included [executive] in our next review to confirm we're aligned on direction?"

---

## Change Control Scripts

**When a change request comes in:**
> "Got it. Let me determine if this is in scope or requires additional time/budget. I'll get back to you by [date]."

**When change is out of scope:**
> "This is outside our agreed scope. I can quote it as an addition—it would be approximately [X days/$X]. Want me to proceed with a formal quote?"

**When pushing back on a change:**
> "I understand why you want this, but adding it now would [delay launch by X / require cutting Y / cost Z more]. Is that trade-off worth it, or should we defer to phase two?"

**When you need written approval:**
> "Before we proceed with this change, I need written confirmation that we're adjusting the [timeline/budget/scope]. Can you reply confirming this is approved?"

**When someone tries to sneak scope in:**
> "This feels like a scope addition rather than a clarification. Let me estimate the impact and we can discuss whether to include it."

## Dealing with Difficult Feedback

### When to Escalate

- Massive overages
- Major communication breakdown
- Cancel project (notify management first)
- Aggressive/violent stakeholders
- Refusal to pay

### Responding to Critical Feedback

- Bump up connection level (call > message)
- Acknowledge the problem
- Document all decisions and risks
- Acknowledge what other person is saying
- State problem and fix
- Lay out plan and clear next steps

## More Scripts for Managing Change

**Say "No":**
- "This idea might pull us further from your goals. Mind if we come back to it later?"
- "We've tried this before - here's what happened. Let's put it in ideas list for next phase."
- "That will take us in the wrong direction. Let's focus on launching what we have."

**Say "Maybe":**
- "Let me go back to my team and get you an answer."
- "Can I have time to think this over? I want to consider all options."
- "Great question. Let me put together a great answer for you."

**Say "Yes, and...":**
- "If we do X, it will add time and budget—let's look at how much."
- "This will add time/budget and we'll need to re-prioritize. Add to ideas list?"
- "Tentative yes if you're open to more budget/time. What do you think?"

**Give Options:**
- "We can do A or B. A means this; B means that. We recommend B. Which path?"
- "If you had to choose, is A or B highest priority?"

**Clarify:**
- "After looking at the data, I don't think it makes sense to do X. Sorry I wasn't clear. Want to discuss options?"
- "I was wrong when I said X. It's actually Y. Let's go over details so we're aligned."
- "When you say X, do you mean this or that?"

## Tips for Managing Change

- Make bullet list of what you've already provided in scope
- Take time to get thoughts straight - you don't need an answer on the spot
- You're only responsible for your half of any relationship
- You can't make people do what they don't want - but can provide guidance
- If you don't catch something immediately, there's usually still time to undo damage
