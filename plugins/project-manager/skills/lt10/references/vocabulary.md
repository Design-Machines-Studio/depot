## Estimation Terms

**ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude):** High-level estimate with wide range (typically -25% to +75%). Used for early budgeting before detailed scoping.

**Bottom-up Estimate:** Detailed estimate built by breaking work into small tasks and summing them. More accurate but time-consuming.

**Sprint:** Time-boxed iteration (usually 1-4 weeks) in Agile development.

**Velocity:** Measure of work completed per sprint, used for forecasting.

## Financial Terms

**Burn Rate:** Rate at which project consumes budget over time.

**Utilization Rate:** Percentage of available time spent on billable work. Optimal: 70-80%.

**Revenue Per Employee:** Annual revenue divided by employee count. Target varies by industry.

**Break-even Rate:** Minimum hourly rate to cover all costs (salary + overhead + profit margin).

**Cost of Sale:** Total cost to acquire and deliver work to a client.

**MLOE (Months Left of Engagement):** Average remaining time across all active client relationships.

## Risk Terms

**Red Flag:** Early warning indicator that something may go wrong. Requires immediate attention.

**Risk:** Uncertain event that could positively or negatively affect project objectives.

**Mitigation:** Actions taken to reduce probability or impact of a risk.

**Contingency:** Pre-planned response activated if a specific risk occurs.

**Contingency Budget:** Reserve funds set aside for identified risks (typically 10-15%).

**Risk Register:** Document tracking identified risks, their probability, impact, and response plans.

## Stakeholder Terms

## Meeting Terms

**Kickoff:** Initial meeting to align team and stakeholders on project goals, scope, and approach.

**Standup:** Brief daily meeting (15 min max) covering progress, plans, and blockers.

**Retrospective:** Post-project meeting to identify what worked, what didn't, and improvements.

**Sprint Review:** End-of-sprint meeting demonstrating completed work to stakeholders.

**Blameless Retrospective:** Review focused on learning without assigning personal fault.

## Quality Terms

**QA (Quality Assurance):** Proactive process ensuring quality standards are followed during work.

**QC (Quality Control):** Reactive testing to verify deliverables meet requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:** Conditions that must be met for work to be considered complete.

**Definition of Done:** Team agreement on what "complete" means for any work item.

**Technical Debt:** Shortcuts taken during development that will require future rework.

## Capacity Terms

**Capacity Planning:** Determining staff availability and allocation across projects.

**Timeboxing:** Allocating fixed time blocks to activities rather than working until complete.

**Think in Threes:** LT10 principle of limiting active projects to three per person.
