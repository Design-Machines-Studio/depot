# Project Methodologies

> **Related sections:** → Scheduling (`scheduling.md`) → Estimation (`estimation.md`) → Scoping (`scoping.md`)

## Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Methodology** | System of methods and principles for how you get work done with others |
| **Process** | Steps or actions you follow to achieve something |
| **Framework** | Loose, incomplete system of rules useful for planning or deciding |
| **Workflow** | Repeatable patterns of activity organizing people and resources |

---

## Waterfall Model

**What it is:** Linear approach where one step must complete before next begins. Dependencies drive everything.

**Flow:** Plan → Build → Test → Launch (Discovery → Design → Development → QA → Launch)

### When to Use Waterfall

- Smaller or predictable projects
- Identity, logo, branding projects
- Print projects (brochures, banners, cards)
- Campaign-based short duration projects
- Traditional stakeholders, formal corporate structures
- Video/animation production
- Fixed budget, fixed timeline, clear scope

### When NOT to Use Waterfall

- Don't know what you're building
- Don't know who you're building for
- Needs continuous improvements
- Building something new with new technology
- Very large and amorphous
- Testing new market (need early feedback)
- Flexible budget and timeline

### Waterfall Subtypes

| Subtype | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sashimi** | Overlapping phases - two people can work on separate phases offset |
| **Risk Reduction** | Tackle riskiest/most valuable pieces first |
| **Subprojects** | Break large project into independent sub-projects |
| **Spiral** | Iterate on each piece to eliminate risk before moving on |

### Waterfall Sinkholes (Avoid These)

| Sinkhole | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **Silos** | Clear hand-off process with knowledge transfer; involve stakeholders early |
| **Scope creep** | Align goals/outcomes frequently; avoid for vague projects |
| **Budget overages** | Nail down scope, get written approval, minimize change requests |
| **Project drag** | Clear conversations about how changes impact timeline |
| **Poor QA** | Build healthy budget for testing; check in before QA phase |

## Lean Approach

**What it is:** Philosophy of removing waste and creating value. Ultimate prioritization of impact vs effort. Originated at Toyota (1990s).

### Core Tenets

- Value
- Flexibility
- Leadership
- Adaptability to change
- Focused on results
- Reduce waste and resources

### Ways to Apply Lean

- Don't pull resources off projects before complete
- Reduce documents and plans; focus on goal alignment
- Keep meetings light or remove if they don't drive forward
- Daily 5-min check-ins instead of monthly half-day meetings
- "Just enough" approach to documentation

### When to Be Less Lean

- Rigid stakeholders with policy/red tape
- Strong legal, corporate, or ethical requirements
- Projects that cannot change or fail
- Skipping steps hurts project or audience

### Lean Sinkholes (Avoid These)

| Sinkhole | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **Undefined scope** | Don't have fixed timeline/budget; lead back to goals |
| **Role confusion** | Over-communicate and collaborate more frequently |
| **Undocumented decisions** | Pass the "bus test" - if decision-maker hit by bus, can team find out why decision was made? |

## Agile Approach

**What it is:** Mindset focusing on continuous improvement, adaptability, ongoing testing, and self-organizing collaborative teams. Iterative refinements with evolving plans.

### The Agile Manifesto (2001) - 12 Principles

1. Satisfy customer through early, continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late
3. Deliver working software frequently (prefer shorter timescales)
4. Business and developers work together daily
5. Build around motivated individuals; trust them
6. Face-to-face conversation most effective
7. Working software is primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable pace indefinitely
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
10. Simplicity—maximize work not done
11. Best designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regular reflection and adjustment

### Modern Agile Tenets

- Make people awesome
- Make safety a prerequisite
- Experiment and learn rapidly
- Deliver value continuously

### Iron Triangle in Agile

| Approach | Fixed | Flexible |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Waterfall** | SCOPE | Time and resources respond |
| **Agile** | TIME and RESOURCES | Scope is flexible |

### When to Use Agile

- Unclear requirements or outcomes
- Building something new with new technology
- Needs continuous improvements
- Testing new market (want early feedback)
- Flexible budget and timeline
- Requires a lot of research

### When NOT to Use Agile

- Rigid stakeholders with legal/review panels
- Small budget, fixed schedule
- Clear requirements you've done before
- Short campaign-based projects

## Scrum Framework

### Core Components

- Sprints (1-2 week timeboxes)
- Sprint planning
- Daily scrums (standups)
- Sprint reviews (demos)
- Sprint retrospectives

### Scrum Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Product Owner** | Owns backlog, prioritizes stories, decides what ships |
| **Scrum Master** | Protects team, manages flow, aligns stakeholders |
| **Development Team** | Translates stories into features |

### Scrum Meetings

| Meeting | Purpose | Duration |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Standup (Daily Scrum)** | What did you do? What will you do? Any blockers? | 5-15 min |
| **Demo** | Present progress to stakeholders at sprint end | Varies |
| **Retrospective** | Stop, Start, Continue - continuous improvement | 30-60 min |
| **Sprint Groom** | Break down and clarify stories | 1-2 hours |
| **Sprint Plan** | Prioritize this sprint's work | 1-2 hours |

## Kanban Approach

**What it is:** Visual, lean approach limiting work in progress. Born from Toyota manufacturing.

### Four Main Tenets

1. Visualize work (increase communication)
2. Limit work in progress (avoid endless non-prioritized tasks)
3. Measure and optimize flow (collect metrics)
4. Aim for continuous improvement (kaizen)

### WIP Limits

Max 5 tasks per person in "Doing" column. Forces focus.

### Basic Columns

To Do → Doing → Done (can add Waiting, In Review)

### When to Use Kanban

- Team prefers visual progress
- Value metrics and continuous improvement
- Internal team with ongoing tasks
- Scope more defined, projects less rigid
- Don't need to estimate per sprint

### When NOT to Use Kanban

- Team prefers process-driven workflows
- Must work in cross-functional teams
- Priorities switch frequently
- Need clear breakdown of time vs budget

## Agifall (Hybrid) Method

**What it is:** Best of Waterfall and Agile blended. Dominant approach for client services.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Discovery:** Set up normal discovery/planning like Waterfall. Define scope and constraints.
2. **Estimate:** Prioritize outcomes, estimate sprint range (e.g., 6-9 sprints)
3. **Charge:** Flat sprint rate; budget is a range (±50% max)
4. **Sprints:** Regular internal sprints, involve client at defined times (weekly vs daily)
5. **Testing:** Build in testing throughout; reserve 1-2 sprints for UAT
6. **Negotiate:** Handle unexpected bugs/changes in new budget/sprint schedule

**Key insight:** Feels like Agile to team, Waterfall to external stakeholders.

### When to Use Agifall

- Complex stakeholders wanting progressive approach
- Timelines of one or more sprints
- Campaign-style quick turnarounds
- Startups with limited funds (MVP)
- Maintenance/retainers

### When NOT to Use Agifall

- Stakeholders with deep pockets wanting full iteration
- Small identity projects
- Product companies needing continuous improvement
- Very short duration projects

## Decision Framework: Methodology Selection

### Choose Based on Project Characteristics

| Characteristic | Waterfall | Agile/Scrum | Kanban | Hybrid (Agifall) |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Scope clarity | Fixed, clear | Flexible, evolving | Continuous flow | Fixed gates, flexible execution |
| Client involvement | Milestone reviews | Daily/weekly collaboration | As needed | Phase reviews + iteration |
| Documentation | Heavy upfront | Minimal, evolving | Just enough | Phase docs + sprint artifacts |
| Change tolerance | Low (change control) | High (embraced) | Medium | Controlled within phases |
| Best for | Construction, regulated | Software, products | Maintenance, support | Client services, agencies |

### Agifall (Hybrid) is Recommended For

- Client service organizations
- Projects with defined phases but uncertain details
- Stakeholders needing milestone visibility
- Teams wanting agile flexibility within waterfall structure

## Common Methodology Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Overestimating sprint capacity** | First 2 sprints will be off—leave wiggle room |
| **Tasks too general** | If can't complete in sprint or estimate, too big |
| **Tasks too specific** | If takes longer to write than complete, too granular |
| **No process clarity** | Align team before starting each project |
| **Underestimating stakeholder onboarding** | Document how you work |
| **Clinging to methodology** | Focus on what works for project and people |
| **Runaway projects** | Maintain tight roadmap, release early and often |

## How to Explain Methodology to Clients

### Explaining Agifall/Hybrid

> "Given your fixed budget and deadline, we'll structure this in phases with clear milestones. Within each phase, we'll work in two-week sprints so you can see progress and we can adjust priorities based on what we learn. You'll have approval gates between phases so nothing moves forward until you're satisfied."

### Explaining Agile

> "We'll work in short cycles—usually two weeks—where we build, test, and get your feedback. This lets us adjust direction quickly based on what we learn. You'll see working software every sprint."

### Explaining Waterfall

> "We'll move through clear phases: first we'll plan everything out, then design, then build, then test. You'll approve each phase before we move to the next. This gives you certainty about what you're getting."
