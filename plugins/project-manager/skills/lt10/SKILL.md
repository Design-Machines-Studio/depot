name: lt10
description: Project management methodology based on Louder Than Ten (LT10) principles for client services, creative agencies, and construction projects. Use when the user needs guidance on estimation (ROM, 90th percentile, red flags), scoping (product vs project scope, scope creep management), pricing (burn rate, rate calculations), scheduling (buffers, Gantt, timeboxing), risk management (red flags, mitigation), stakeholder alignment (communication plans, RACI), change control, methodology selection (Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Hybrid/Agifall), team dynamics, and professional development. Applies to digital projects, house construction, and any complex multi-stakeholder initiative.

# Louder Than Ten Project Management Methodology

Human-centered PM approach emphasizing realistic estimation, stakeholder alignment, and adaptive methodology selection.

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

### The LT10 Estimation Formula
```
1. Get 90th percentile LOW-HIGH range (internal)
2. Score red flags per section (1-5 scale)
3. Calculate: ((High - Low) × RedFlag%) + Low = Midpoint
4. Present MIDPOINT (~68% confidence) to client with red flags visible
```
**Remember:** 90th percentile high is your ceiling, NOT your quote.

### Estimating vs Billing Units
| Unit | Estimate With? | Bill With? |
|------|----------------|------------|
| Days | ✅ Yes (internal) | ❌ No |
| Sprints/Weeks | Project length | ✅ Yes (to clients) |
| Hourly | ❌ No | ❌ Avoid |

**Workflow:** Estimate in days → Convert to sprints → Present sprints to client

### Four Types of Scope Creep
| Type | What It Is | Fix |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Business** | Stakeholders change mind/priorities | Document everything, Mystery Voices clause |
| **Effort** | Wheels spinning, no progress | Remove blockers, get help |
| **Hope** | Lying that you'll meet deadline | Speak up early, be honest |
| **Feature** | Adding unrequested extras | Say no, defer to phase 2 |

### Methodology Selection (Quick)
| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Fixed scope, clear requirements | Waterfall |
| Unclear requirements, need flexibility | Agile |
| Visual progress, ongoing work | Kanban |
| Complex stakeholders, phased approach | Agifall (Hybrid) |

### Capacity Rules
- **Think in threes:** Max 3 projects per person
- **6-hour day:** Real productive time, not 8
- **70-80% utilization:** Leave room for admin, unexpected

### Key Scripts (Use These)

**When scope creep appears:**
> "I'll check with the team on impact. This may add time and budget—are you okay with that?"

**When rejecting a request:**
> "Looking at the data, I don't think X makes sense. Want to discuss alternatives?"

**When estimate is challenged:**
> "This includes buffer for unknowns. Reducing it means accepting more risk. Are you comfortable with that trade-off?"

**When feedback is slow:**
> "I haven't heard back on X and it's blocking progress. Can we get 15 minutes to review?"

### Red Flags to Watch
- Stakeholders arguing about direction
- Point of contact goes silent
- Salesperson estimates without team
- "Can you just..." requests
- New decision-makers appearing late

## Core Philosophy & Identity

**The LT10 Manifesto:**
- Be a human first and project lead second
- PM is about **people**, not projects
- Create democratic work environments
- Reject the "pencil pusher" or "traffic cop" identity
- You are the nucleus holding everything together

**What PM Really Is:**
- Anchoring team and stakeholders to the 'why', not just what and how
- Understanding how profitability and sustainability hold everyone accountable
- Keeping eyes on technology, economic, and industry trends
- Systems-level thinking combined with tactical execution

**What PM Is NOT:**
- Keeping head down tracking budgets/timelines without knowing why
- Documentation without understanding organizational impact
- Throwing team under the bus to save face
- Telling people what to do hierarchically

## The Four Pillars of PM Development

1. **You** - Professional development and PM specialization
2. **Soft & Hard Skills** - Developing the right balance for the trade
3. **Process** - Theory and knowledge of PM concepts
4. **Practice** - Applying knowledge to real and simulated projects

## Project Lifecycle Phases

1. **Project Intake** - PM role during sales or project vetting
2. **Project Setup** - Kickoff, stakeholder alignment, tools
3. **Project Planning** - Scope, estimates, schedules, risks
4. **Project Management & Delivery** - Execution, change control, communication
5. **Project Close & Transition** - Handoff, retrospective, documentation

## Sales & Project Intake (Summary)

### Project/Client Alignment Matrix
```
                    Goal Alignment
           Misaligned ←────────→ Aligned
                │
    Low Risk    │   Can Develop  │   NURTURE
    (top)       │   (not bad)    │   (seek these)
    ────────────┼────────────────┼────────────
    High Risk   │   AVOID        │   SINISTER TRAP
    (bottom)    │   (guaranteed  │   (tempting but
                │    failure)    │    riddled with
                │                │    red flags)
```

**Bottom right is most dangerous:** Projects that appear aligned but have major red flags.

### Discovery Phase
**Never sell solutions before understanding the problem.**

- **Minimum:** 10% of overall budget for simple projects
- **Complex projects:** Up to 50% of effort on defining, 50% on completing
- **80% of project success is determined by first 20% of project's life.**

---

## Project Plans & Documentation (Summary)

### What Goes in a Project Plan
- Time, Scope, Budget
- People & roles
- Assumptions & risks
- Process and approach
- Communication plan
- Quality assurance

### Statement of Work (SOW)
Legal document outlining all pieces of project including product scope.

**The Tragedy of Cementing Early Scope:** 98% of firms badly underestimate projects because SOW locks in fixed price AND fixed schedule before adequate research.

### Scope Protection Clauses
- **Pause Clause:** Project pauses if deliverables/approvals >5 days late
- **Mystery Voices Clause:** New stakeholders require scope re-evaluation
- **Mimic Clause:** Delayed deliverables extend all future dates

---

## Meetings & Collaboration (Summary)

**"Think of every minute of a meeting as a crisp dollar bill burning at the corners."**

### Six Meeting Types
| Type | Duration | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Status/Progress | 10-15 min | Where were we, are we, will we be? |
| Information Sharing | Varies | Knowledge transfer |
| Problem Solving | Allow room | Conflict resolution, alignment |
| Decision Making | Keep tight | Determine actionables |
| Team Building | Schedule regularly | Strengthen teams, build trust |
| Creative/Inventive | Book lots of time | Test ideas, deepen understanding |

### Meeting Non-Negotiables
- Clear agenda and goals in every invite
- Record meetings or have great notetaker
- Restate goals at start, outcomes at end
- Always have backup (phone number, alt link)

## Prioritization Frameworks (Summary)

### Impact vs Effort Matrix
```
        High Impact
             │
   Do First  │ Do Second
   (Quick    │ (Major
    Wins)    │  Projects)
─────────────┼─────────────
   Do Third  │ Don't Do
   (Fill-ins)│ (Time Sinks)
             │
        Low Impact
   Low Effort ──────── High Effort
```

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must have:** Non-negotiable, core functionality
- **Should have:** Important but not critical for launch
- **Could have:** Nice to have if time/budget allows
- **Won't have:** Explicitly out of scope this phase

---

## Team Dynamics (Summary)

### Team Development Stages (Tuckman)
**Forming → Storming → Norming → Performing → Adjourning**

### Preventing Burnout
PM is accountable to team for time, budget, and resources they need. **Don't throw team under bus for impossible deadlines.**

### Toxic Teammates
- **Lone Wolf:** Works in silos, not interested in collaboration
- **Firefighter/Golden Child:** Heroes who create faulty expectations (most dangerous)

**Brooks's Law:** Adding resources late makes project later.

---

## QA & Launch (Summary)

### QA + QC = Success
- **Quality Assurance (QA):** Proactive plan for checking quality during creation
- **Quality Control (QC):** Reactive process ensuring you built product right

**QA Budget:** Minimum 15% of development budget for testing.

### Launch Rules
- Never launch on Friday
- Confirm all contract requirements met
- Prepare for request uptick pre/post launch
- Schedule retrospective

---

## Maintenance & Future Phases (Summary)

### Why Maintenance Matters
- Products degrade over time
- Technology changes constantly
- Easier to maintain stakeholders than start fresh

### Turn Maintenance into Future Phases
Position incoming work as dedicated project with own budget and timeline for ongoing revenue with clear boundaries.

## PM Self-Care

**"There are no heroes in PM. If you don't care for yourself, you become the self-sacrificing toxic teammate."**

Top priority: Physical, mental, emotional health. **If you come last, you cannot be effective.**
